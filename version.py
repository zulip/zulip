# API_FEATURE_LEVEL is bumped exclusively by tools/merge-api-changelogs, run by

# API change, you run `tools/create-api-changelog`, which creates a special API
# changelog file and unique random ID for you to use when documentating your API
# change. For full process, see:
# https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/api.html#step-by-step-guide

# Bump the minor PROVISION_VERSION to indicate that folks should provision
# only when going from an old version of the code to a newer version. Bump
# the major version to indicate that folks should provision in both
# directions.

# Typically,
# * adding a dependency only requires a minor version bump;
# * removing a dependency requires a major version bump;
# * upgrading a dependency requires a major version bump, unless the
#   upgraded dependency is backwards compatible with all of our
#   historical commits sharing the same major version, in which case a
#   minor version bump suffices.
