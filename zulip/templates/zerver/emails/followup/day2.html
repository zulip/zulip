<p>Hey,</p>

<p>I wanted to share one last thing with you: a few tips about topics, since mastering topics is a key part of being a Zulip power user.</p>

<p>Topics are like email subject lines. The big difference, though, is that they're really short and lightweight. One or two words will do it. Don't overthink 'em&mdash;you can always edit the message later!</p>

<ul>
    <li>Bad topics: "What do people think of this new screenshot?", "I'm looking at Bug 345",  "Where should we go to lunch?"</li>
    <li>Good topics: screenshot, Bug 345, lunch</li>
</ul>

<p>Why bother with topics? Well, two reasons: it makes conversations clearer (imagine if email didn't have them!), and it lets you more efficiently catch up on what's happened while you're away&mdash;read the topics that are relevant to you, and ignore the ones that aren't!</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />Zulip</p>
