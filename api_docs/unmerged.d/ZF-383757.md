* [`POST /realm/emoji/{emoji_name}`](/api/upload-custom-emoji):
Added a new request body parameter `resize_method` which allows
the user to control how the uploaded emoji is resized.
If `resize_method` is set as `crop` the emoji is cropped to a square,
whereas setting it as `fit` pads the emoji to a square.
