* [`POST /messages`](/api/send-message), [`PATCH /messages/{message_id}`](/api/update-message):
  These endpoints now return a specific error response (`"code": USER_GROUP_MENTION_NOT_ALLOWED`)
  when a message is rejected because it contains a user group mention
  that the user doesn't have permission to use. The error response
  includes `user_group_name` to help clients identify which group mention failed.
