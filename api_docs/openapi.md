# OpenAPI

OpenAPI is a standard format for describing RESTful APIs. It allows us to keep our documentation up-to-date and accurate.

You can find the OpenAPI specification file for Zulip's API [here](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/main/zerver/openapi/zulip.yaml). You can also download the raw file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zulip/zulip/main/zerver/openapi/zulip.yaml).

## Tools

There are several tools that can be useful when working with OpenAPI specifications:

* [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) - A browser-based editor for OpenAPI files.
* [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) - A tool for generating API client libraries, server stubs, and API documentation from OpenAPI specifications.

In the future, we plan to provide generated API bindings using `openapi-generator`.
