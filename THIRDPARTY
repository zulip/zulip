 LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
 ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION
 ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE
 USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND
 DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT
 OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
 .
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
 and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work
 of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
 the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
 fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
 other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
 whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
 purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the
 ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural
 and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
 their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or
 she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
 elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under
 its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those
 rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
 limited to, the following:
 .
 i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
 communicate, and translate a Work;
 .
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 .
 iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
 likeness depicted in a Work;
 .
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
 subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
 v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of
 data in a Work;
 .
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of
 the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
 protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
 including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
 .
 vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
 world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
 implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
 of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
 irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
 Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
 of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
 future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
 worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
 treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
 future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
 whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
 promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the
 benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of
 Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall
 not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
 any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of
 the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement
 of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
 be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
 Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
 account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
 extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
 person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non
 exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories
 worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
 treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
 future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
 whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
 promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed
 effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should
 any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
 ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
 ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and
 in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
 exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the
 Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with
 respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
 Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
 surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 .
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
 warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory
 or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
 merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
 the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
 absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
 extent permissible under applicable law.
 .
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
 persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
 limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
 Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
 consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
 .
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
 party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
 this CC0 or use of the Work.

 SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 .
 PREAMBLE
 .
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development
 of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic
 and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which
 fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed
 freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any
 derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any
 software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The
 fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license.
 The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any
 document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .
