# The Zulip API bindings, from its own repository.  We integrate with
# these tightly, including fetching content not included in the official
# PyPI release tarballs, such as logos, assets and documentation files
# that we render on our /integrations page. Therefore, we need to pin
# the version from Git rather than a PyPI release. Keeping everything in
# one repository simplifies the process of implementing and documenting
# new bots for new contributors.
