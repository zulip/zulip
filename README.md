# Zulip overview

Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application that combines the
immediacy of real-time chat with the productivity benefits of threaded
conversations. Zulip is used by open source projects, Fortune 500 companies,
large standards bodies, and others who need a real-time chat system that
allows users to easily process hundreds or thousands of messages a day. With
over 500 contributors merging over 500 commits a month, Zulip is also the
largest and fastest growing open source group chat project.
