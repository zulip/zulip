License: CC-BY-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
 TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
 BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
  a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
     other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
     derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
     literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
     cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
     recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
     derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
     Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
     this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
     work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
     timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
     Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
  b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
     encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
     broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
     in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
     arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
     which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
     with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
     independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
     collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
     considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
     License.
  c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
     copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
     other transfer of ownership.
  d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
     offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
  e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
     the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work
     or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in
     addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
     musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
     play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
     expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
     being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
     performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
     organization that transmits the broadcast.
  f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
     of this License including without limitation any production in the
     literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
     form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,
     pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
     of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
     choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
     composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
     assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
     a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
     lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
     expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
     art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
     relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
     performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the
     extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by
     a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
     considered a literary or artistic work.
  g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
     respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
     Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
     violation.
  h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
     to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
     process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
     performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
     members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
     place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
     by any means or process and the communication to the public of the
     performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to
     broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
     sounds or images.
  i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
     without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
     fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
     protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
     medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collections;
  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
     including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
     clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
     to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
     original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
     modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
     in Collections; and,
  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
         reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
         exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
     ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
         exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
         of the rights granted under this License; and,
    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
         Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
         voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
         by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
 other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
 granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
     of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
     on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
     the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
     Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
     to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
     Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
     measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
     Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
     the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
     incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
     apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
     License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
     must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
     as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
     Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
     practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
     Section 4(b), as requested.
  b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
     Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
     Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
     provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
     name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
     and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
     or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
     attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
     terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
     or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
     extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
     specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
     refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
     and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
     a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
     "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
     this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
     provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
     a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
     authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
     credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
     other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
     use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
     in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
     License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
     connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
     Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
     use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
     permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
     Parties.
  c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
     Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
     take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
     prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
     agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
     of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
     make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
     modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
     Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
     as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
     applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
     right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
     but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
 OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
     from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
     terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
     compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
     survive any termination of this License.
  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
     perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
     Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
     Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
     any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
     withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
     required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
     License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
     stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
     the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
     terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
     offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
     terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
     the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
     by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
     the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
     enforceable.
  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
     and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
     respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
     for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
     September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
     and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
     These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
     jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
     according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
     those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
     standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
     includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
     additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
     License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
     applicable law.

      under this Public License.

 Section 2 -- Scope.
 .
   a. License grant.
 .
         1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
            Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
            non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in
            the Licensed Material to:
 .
            A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
 .
            B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
         2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
            Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License
            does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms
            and conditions.
 .
         3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
 .
         4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
         authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and
         formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical

         not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
         modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
         technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
         Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications
         authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
         5. Downstream recipients
 .
            A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
               the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
               Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
               conditions of this Public License.
 .
            B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
               additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
               Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material
               if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by
               any recipient of the Licensed Material.
 .
         6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
            be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or
            that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or
            sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor
            or others designated to receive attribution as provided in
            Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
   b. Other rights.
 .
      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed
         under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or
         other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible,
         the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights
         held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow
         You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
 .
      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
         royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
         directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
         waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other
         cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
   a. Attribution.
 .
      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),
         You must:
 .
         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with
            the Licensed Material:
 .
            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material
               and any others designated to receive attribution, in any
               reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by
               pseudonym if designated);
 .
            ii. a copyright notice;
 .
            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
 .
            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
               reasonably practicable;
 .
         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an
            indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,
            and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this
            Public License.
 .
      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
         manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share
         the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy
         the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that
         includes the required information.
 .
      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
         required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
 .
      4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License
         You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from
         complying with this Public License.
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply
 to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
      extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of
      the contents of the database;
 .
   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents
      in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the
      database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its
      individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
 .
   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
 Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
 other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
 .
   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
      possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
      and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
      Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This
      includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
      for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
      defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not
      known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in
      full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
 .
   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
      any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise
      for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
      exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this
      Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been
      advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where
      a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation
      may not apply to You.
 .
   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall
      be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
      approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 – Term and Termination.
 .
 .
   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
      licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,
      then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
 .
   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
      Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
         cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
 .
      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right
      the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this
      Public License.
 .
   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
      Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
      Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate
      this Public License.
 .
   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
 .
 Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
 .
   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms
      or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .
   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
      Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms
      and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 Section 8 – Interpretation.
 .
 .
   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall
      not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions
      on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
      permission under this Public License.
 .
   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot
      be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without
      affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
 .
   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
 .
   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
      limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to
      the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction
      or authority.

 .
             a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                in part; and

 .
        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
           6(a).
 .

           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
           (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
        5. Downstream recipients.
 .
             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically

                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                Public License.
 .

                Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
             c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                Material.
 .
        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
   b. Other rights.
 .
        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not

           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
           Rights, but not otherwise.

           Public License.

           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
           reserves any right to collect such royalties.

 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
   a. Attribution.
 .
        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
           form), You must:
 .
             a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                with the Licensed Material:
 .
                  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                     Material and any others designated to receive
                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                     designated);
 .
                 ii. a copyright notice;
 .
                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                     warranties;
 .
                  v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                     extent reasonably practicable;
 .
             b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
             c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
           which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
           reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
           information.
 .
        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
           reasonably practicable.
 .
   b. ShareAlike.
 .
      In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
      Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
 .
        1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
           license with the same License Elements, this version or
           later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
 .
        2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
           Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
           in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
           context in which You Share Adapted Material.
 .
        3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
           or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
           Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
           rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
      portion of the contents of the database;
 .
   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
 .
      including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
      waiver of all liability.
 .
 .
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
      terminate automatically.
 .
   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
      Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
           it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
           violation; or
 .
        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
      of this Public License.
 .
   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
      will not terminate this Public License.
 .
   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
      License.
 .
 .
 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .
   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 .
 Section 8 -- Interpretation.
 .
   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
      be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
      conditions.
 .
   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
      Licensor.
 .
   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

License: CC0-1.0
 Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal
 CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
 LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
 ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION
 ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE
 USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND
 DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT
 OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
 .
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
 and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work
 of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
 the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
 fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
 other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
 whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
 purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the
 ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural
 and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
 their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or
 she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
 elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under
 its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those
 rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
 limited to, the following:
 .
 i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
 communicate, and translate a Work;
 .
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 .
 iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
 likeness depicted in a Work;
 .
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
 subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
 v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of
 data in a Work;
 .
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of
 the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
 protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
 including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
 .
 vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
 world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
 implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
 of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
 irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
 Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
 of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
 future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
 worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
 treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
 future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
 whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
 promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the
 benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of
 Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall
 not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
 any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of
 the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement
 of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
 be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
 Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
 account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
 extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
 person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non
 exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories
 worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
 treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
 future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
 whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
 promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed
 effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should
 any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
 ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
 ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and
 in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
 exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the
 Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with
 respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
 Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
 surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 .
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
 warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory
 or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
 merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
 the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
 absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
 extent permissible under applicable law.
 .
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
 persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
 limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
 Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
 consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
 .
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
 party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
 this CC0 or use of the Work.
