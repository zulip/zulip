# Development environment installation

Zulip support a wide range of ways to install the Zulip development
environment.  We recommend using the Vagrant development environment,
since it is easiest to setup and uninstall.  If you have a very slow
network connection, however, you may want to avoid installing Vagrant
(which involves downloading an Ubuntu image) and either install
[directly](install-ubuntu-without-vagrant-dev.html) or use
[the manual install process](install-generic-unix-dev.html) instead.

* [Brief installation instructions for Vagrant development environment](brief-install-vagrant-dev.html)
* [Installing on Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty or 16.04 Xenial directly](install-ubuntu-without-vagrant-dev.html).
  This offers the most convenient developer experience, but is difficult to uninstall.
