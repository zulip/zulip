# Translating Zulip

Zulip has full support for unicode, so you can already use your
preferred language everywhere in Zulip.

To make Zulip even better for users around the world, the Zulip UI is
being translated into a number of major languages, including Spanish,
German, French, Chinese, Russian, and Japanese, with varying levels of
progress.  If you speak a language other than English, your help with
translating Zulip would be greatly appreciated!

If you're interested in contributing translations to Zulip, join the
[Zulip project on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/zulip/zulip/)
and ask to join any languages you'd like to contribute to (or add new
ones).  Transifex's notification system sometimes fails to notify the
maintainers when you ask to join a project, so please send a quick
email to zulip-core@googlegroups.com when you request to join the
project or add a language so that we can be sure to accept your
request to contribute.

## Translation Tags

All user-facing text in the Zulip UI should be generated by a HTML
template so that it can be translated.

Zulip uses two types of templates: backend templates (powered by the
[Jinja2][] template engine, though the original [Django][] template
engine is still supported) and frontend templates (powered by
[Handlebars][]).  At present, the frontend templates don't support
translation (though we're working on fixing this!), so the rest of
this discussion will be about the backend templates.

To mark a string for translation in the Jinja2 and Django template
engines, you can use the `_()` function in the templates like this:

```
{{ _("English text") }}
```

If a string contains both a literal string component and variables,
you can use a block translation, which makes use of placeholders to
help translators to translated an entire sentence.  To translate a
block, Jinja2 uses the [trans][] tag while Django uses the
[blocktrans][] tag.  So rather than writing something ugly and
confusing for translators like this:

```
# Don't do this!
{{ _("This string will have") }} {{ value }} {{ _("inside") }}
```

You can instead use:

```
# Jinja2 style
{% trans %}This string will have {{ value }} inside.{% endtrans %}
# Django style
{% blocktrans %}This string will have {{ value }} inside.{% endblocktrans %}
```
