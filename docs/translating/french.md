## Rules

- Use of _vous_ instead of _tu_;
- A non-breaking space before a colon and a semi-colon;
- A space after a colon, a semi-colon, a dot and a comma;
- Follow English capitalization;
- Prefer the infinitive form of a verb: _Save_ into _Sauver_ (instead of _Sauvez_).

Some translations can be tricky, so please don't hesitate to ask the community or contribute to this guide.

## Terms

Please refer to the [Weblate
glossary](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/zulip/glossary/fr/) for
recommended translations. If some important word is missing from the
glossary, please ask in [#translation/fr][].
