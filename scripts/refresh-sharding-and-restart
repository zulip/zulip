# In the ordering of operations below, the crucial detail is that
# zulip-django and zulip-workers:* need to be restarted before
# reloading nginx. Django has an in-memory map of which realm belongs
# to which shard. Reloading nginx will cause users' tornado requests
# to be routed according to the new sharding scheme. If that happens
# before Django is restarted, updating its realm->shard map, users on
# realms, whose shard has changed, will have their tornado requests
# handled by the new tornado process, while Django will still use the
# old process for its internal communication with tornado when
# servicing the user's requests.  That's a bad state that leads to
# clients getting into reload loops ending in crashing on 500 response
# while Django is restarting.  For this reason it's important to
# reload nginx only after Django.
