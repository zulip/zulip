# DIFFS: Noise suppression.
#
# Suppress noisy generated files in diffs.
# (When you actually want to see these diffs, use `git diff -a`.)

# Large test fixtures:
corporate/tests/stripe_fixtures/*.json -diff


# FORMATTING

# Maintain LF (Unix-style) newlines in text files.
*   text=auto eol=lf

# Make sure various media files never get somehow auto-detected as text
# and then newline-converted.
