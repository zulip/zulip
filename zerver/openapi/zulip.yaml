      operationId: fetch-api-key
      summary: Fetch an API key (production)
      tags: ["authentication"]
      description: |
        This API endpoint is used by clients such as the Zulip mobile and
        terminal apps to implement password-based authentication. Given the
        user's Zulip login credentials, it returns a Zulip API key that the client
        can use to make requests as the user.

        This endpoint is only useful for Zulip servers/organizations with
        EmailAuthBackend or LDAPAuthBackend enabled.

        The Zulip mobile apps also support SSO/social authentication (GitHub
        auth, Google auth, SAML, etc.) that does not use this endpoint. Instead,
        the mobile apps reuse the web login flow passing the `mobile_flow_otp` in
        a webview, and the credentials are returned to the app (encrypted) via a redirect
        to a `zulip://` URL.

        !!! warn ""

            **Note:** If you signed up using passwordless authentication and
            never had a password, you can [reset your password](/help/change-your-password).

        See the [API keys](/api/api-keys) documentation for more details
        on how to download an API key manually.

        In a [Zulip development environment](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/overview.html),
        see also [the unauthenticated variant](/api/dev-fetch-api-key).

      description: |
        For easy testing of mobile apps and other clients and against Zulip
        development servers, we support fetching a Zulip API key for any user
        on the development server without authentication (so that they can
        implement analogues of the one-click login process available for Zulip
        development servers on the web).

            **Note:** This endpoint is only available on Zulip development
            servers; for obvious security reasons it will always return an error
            in a Zulip production server.

      description: |
        This endpoint allows you to receive new events from
        [a registered event queue](/api/register-queue).

        Long-lived clients should use the
        `event_queue_longpoll_timeout_seconds` property returned by
        `POST /register` as the client-side HTTP request timeout for
        calls to this endpoint. It is guaranteed to be higher than
        heartbeat frequency and should be respected by clients to
        avoid breaking when heartbeat frequency increases.

            [the `POST /register` endpoint](/api/register-queue) to this
            endpoint and a queue would be registered in the absence of a `queue_id`.

                                    Clients should generally handle an unknown property received here without
                                    crashing, since that will naturally happen when connecting to a Zulip
                                    server running a new version that adds a new subscription property.

                                    **Changes**: As of Zulip 6.0 (feature level 139), updates to the `is_muted`
                                    property or the deprecated `in_home_view` property will send two `subscription`
                                    update events, one for each property, to support clients fully migrating to
                                    use the `is_muted` property. Prior to this feature level, updates to either
                                    property only sent one event with the deprecated `in_home_view` property.

                                When a user subscribes to a stream, the current user will receive this
                                event only if they [have permission to see the stream's subscriber
                                list](/help/channel-permissions). When the current user gains permission
                                to see a given stream's subscriber list, they will receive this event
                                for the existing subscriptions to the stream.

                                **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 8.0 (feature level 220), this event was
                                incorrectly not sent to guest users when subscribers to web-public
                                streams and subscribed public streams changed.

                                Prior to Zulip 8.0 (feature level 205), this event was not sent when
                                a user gained access to a stream due to their [role
                                changing](/help/roles-and-permissions).

                                Prior to Zulip 6.0 (feature level 134), this event was not sent when a
                                private stream was made public.

                                In Zulip 4.0 (feature level 35), the singular `user_id` and `stream_id`
                                integers included in this event were replaced with plural `user_ids` and
                                `stream_ids` integer arrays.

                                In Zulip 3.0 (feature level 19), the `stream_id` field was added to
                                identify the stream the user subscribed to, replacing the `name` field.

                                    Clients should inspect the flags field rather than assuming that
                                    new messages are unread; [muted users](/api/mute-user), messages
                                    sent by the current user, and more subtle scenarios can result
                                    in a new message that the server has already marked as read for
                                    the user.

                                    **Changes**: In Zulip 8.0 (feature level 224), the `wildcard_mentioned`
                                    flag was deprecated in favor of the `stream_wildcard_mentioned` and
                                    `topic_wildcard_mentioned` flags. The `wildcard_mentioned` flag exists
                                    for backwards compatibility with older clients and equals
                                    `stream_wildcard_mentioned || topic_wildcard_mentioned`. Clients
                                    supporting older server versions should treat this field as a previous
                                    name for the `stream_wildcard_mentioned` flag as topic wildcard mentions
                                    were not available prior to this feature level.

                                A simple event sent when the set of invitations changes.
                                This event is sent to organization administrators and the creator of
                                the changed invitation; this tells clients they need to refetch
                                data from `GET /invites` if they are displaying UI containing active
                                invitations.

                                only sent to organization administrators.

                                Event sent to all users in a Zulip organization when a new
                                user joins or when a guest user gains access to a user.
                                Processing this event is important to being able to display
                                basic details on other users given only their ID.

                                If the current user is a guest whose access to a newly created user
                                is limited by a `can_access_all_users_group` policy, and the event
                                queue was registered with the `user_list_incomplete` client
                                capability, then the event queue will not receive an event for such
                                a new user. If a newly created user is inaccessible to the current
                                user via such a policy, but the client lacks `user_list_incomplete`
                                client capability, then this event will be delivered to the queue,
                                with an "Unknown user" object with the usual format but placeholder
                                data whose only variable content is the user ID.

                                **Changes**: Before Zulip 8.0 (feature level 232), the
                                `user_list_incomplete` client capability did not exist, and so all
                                clients whose access to a new user was prevented by
                                `can_access_all_users_group` policy would receive a fake "Unknown
                                user" event for such a user.

                                **Changes**: Starting with Zulip 8.0 (feature level 228),
                                this event is also sent when a guest user gains access to
                                a user.

                                    One should use the standard Zulip rendered_markdown CSS when
                                    displaying this content so that emoji, LaTeX, and other syntax
                                    work correctly. And any client-side security logic for
                                    user-generated message content should be applied when displaying
                                    this HTML as though it were the body of a Zulip message.

                                    Currently always true for public streams (i.e. `"invite_only": false` implies
                                    `"history_public_to_subscribers": true`), but clients should not make that
                                    assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.

                                    Array of tuples, where each tuple describes a muted topic.
                                    The first element of the tuple is the stream name in which the topic
                                    has to be muted, the second element is the topic name to be muted

                                    **Changes**: Before Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1), the `muted_topics`
                                    array objects were 2-item tuples and did not include the timestamp
                                    information for when the topic was muted.

                                Event sent when the set of onboarding steps to show for the current user
                                has changed (e.g. because the user dismissed one).

                                Clients that feature a similar tutorial experience to the Zulip web app
                                may want to handle these events.

                                `hotspots`. Prior to this feature level, one-time notice onboarding
                                steps were not supported.

                                    such as for an [inline URL preview][inline-url-previews].

                                    **Changes**: As of Zulip 5.0 (feature level 114), this field
                                    is present for all `update_message` events. Previously, this
                                    field was omitted for [inline URL preview][inline-url-previews]
                                    updates.
                                rendering_only:

                                    Whether the event only updates the rendered content of the message.

                                    This field should be used by clients to determine if the event
                                    only provides a rendering update to the message content,
                                    such as for an [inline URL preview][inline-url-previews].
                                    When `true`, the event does not reflect a user-generated edit
                                    and does not modify the message history.

                                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 114). Clients can
                                    correctly identify these rendering update event with earlier
                                    Zulip versions by checking whether the `user_id` field was omitted.
                                message_id:
                                  type: integer

                                    The ID of the message which was edited or updated.

                                    This field should be used to apply content edits to the client's
                                    cached message history, or to apply rendered content updates.

                                    If the stream or topic was changed, the set of moved messages is
                                    encoded in the separate `message_ids` field, which is guaranteed
                                    to include `message_id`.
                                message_ids:

                                    The list of IDs of messages to which any stream or topic changes
                                    encoded in this event should be applied.

                                    These messages are guaranteed to have all been previously sent
                                    to stream `stream_id` with topic `orig_subject`, and have been
                                    moved to `new_stream_id` with topic `subject` (if those fields
                                    are present in the event).

                                    Clients processing these events should update all cached message
                                    history associated with the moved messages (including adjusting
                                    `unread_msgs` data structures, where the client may not have the
                                    message itself in its history) to reflect the new stream and
                                    topic.

                                    Content changes should be applied only to the single message
                                    indicated by `message_id`.
                                flags:

                                    message with ID `message_id` following the edit.

                                    A client application should compare these to the original flags
                                    to identify cases where a mention or alert word was added by the
                                    edit.

                                    **Changes**: In Zulip 8.0 (feature level 224), the `wildcard_mentioned`
                                    flag was deprecated in favor of the `stream_wildcard_mentioned` and
                                    `topic_wildcard_mentioned` flags. The `wildcard_mentioned` flag exists
                                    for backwards compatibility with older clients and equals
                                    `stream_wildcard_mentioned || topic_wildcard_mentioned`. Clients
                                    supporting older server versions should treat this field as a previous
                                    name for the `stream_wildcard_mentioned` flag as topic wildcard mentions
                                    were not available prior to this feature level.

                                    are recommended to use the `stream_id` field instead.

                                    - `"change_later"`: Change messages in the same topic that had
                                      been sent after this one.
                                    - `"change_all"`: Change all messages in that topic.

                                    This parameter should be used to decide whether to change
                                    navigation and compose box state in response to the edit. For
                                    example, if the user was previously in topic narrow, and the
                                    topic was edited with `"change_later"` or `"change_all"`, the Zulip
                                    web app will automatically navigate to the new topic narrow.
                                    Similarly, a message being composed to the old topic should
                                    have its recipient changed to the new topic.

                                    This navigation makes it much more convenient to move content
                                    between topics without disruption or messages continuing
                                    to be sent to the pre-edit topic by accident.

                                Event sent to a user when [message flags][message-flags] are added
                                to messages.

                                This can reflect a direct user action, or can be the indirect
                                consequence of another action. Whatever the cause, if there's a change
                                in the set of message flags that the user has for a message, then an
                                `update_message_flags` event will be sent with the change. Note
                                that this applies when the user already had access to the message, and
                                continues to have access to it. When a message newly appears or
                                disappears, a [`message`][message-event] or
                                [`delete_message`][message-delete] event is sent instead.

                                Some examples of actions that trigger an `update_message_flags`
                                event:

                                - The `"starred"` flag is added when the user chooses to [star a
                                  message](/help/star-a-message).
                                - The `"read"` flag is added when the user marks messages as read by
                                  scrolling through them, or uses [Mark all messages as read][all-read]
                                  on a conversation.
                                - The `"read"` flag is added when the user [mutes](/help/mute-a-user) a
                                  message's sender.
                                - The `"read"` flag is added after the user unsubscribes from a stream,
                                  or messages are moved to a not-subscribed stream, provided the user
                                  can still access the messages at all. Note a
                                  [`delete_message`][message-delete] event is sent in the case where the
                                  user can no longer access the messages.

                                In some cases, a change in message flags that's caused by another change
                                may happen a short while after the original change, rather than
                                simultaneously. For example, when messages that were unread are moved to
                                a stream where the user is not subscribed, the resulting change in
                                message flags (and the corresponding `update_message_flags` event with
                                flag `"read"`) may happen later than the message move itself. The delay
                                in that example is typically at most a few hundred milliseconds and can
                                in rare cases be minutes or longer.

                                    Previously, this was called `subgroup_ids`, but
                                    clients can ignore older events as this feature level
                                    predates subgroups being fully implemented.
                              example:

                                Event sent to all users in a Zulip organization when the
                                set of configured [linkifiers](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier)
                                for the organization has changed.

                                Processing this event is important for doing Markdown local echo
                                correctly.

                                Clients will not receive this event unless the event queue is
                                registered with the client capability
                                `{"linkifier_url_template": true}`.
                                See [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue#parameter-client_capabilities)
                                for how client capabilities can be specified.

                                **Changes**: Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 176), the
                                `linkifier_url_template` client capability was not required. The
                                requirement was added because linkifiers were updated to contain
                                a URL template instead of a URL format string, which was not a
                                backwards-compatible change.

                                New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 54), replacing the deprecated
                                `realm_filters` event type.

                                    An array of tuples, where each tuple described a linkifier. The first
                                    element of the tuple was a string regex pattern which represented the
                                    pattern to be linkified on matching, for example `"#(?P<id>[123])"`.
                                    The second element was the URL format string that the pattern should be
                                    linkified with. A URL format string for the above example would be
                                    `"https://realm.com/my_realm_filter/%(id)s"`. And the third element

                                The simpler of two possible event types sent to all users
                                in a Zulip organization when the configuration of the
                                organization (realm) has changed.

                                Often individual settings are migrated from this format to
                                the [realm/update_dict](#realm-update_dict) event format when additional realm
                                settings are added whose values are coupled to each other
                                in some way. The specific values supported by this event
                                type are documented in the [realm/update_dict](#realm-update_dict)
                                documentation.

                                A correct client implementation should convert these
                                events into the corresponding [realm/update_dict](#realm-update_dict)
                                event and then process that.

                                Event sent to all users in a Zulip organization when the
                                organization (realm) is deactivated. Its main purpose is to
                                flush active longpolling connections so clients can immediately
                                show the organization as deactivated.

                                Clients cannot rely on receiving this event, because they will
                                no longer be able to authenticate to the Zulip API due to the
                                deactivation, and thus can miss it if they did not have an active
                                longpolling connection at the moment of deactivation.

                                Correct handling of realm deactivations requires that clients
                                parse authentication errors from GET /events; if that is done
                                correctly, the client can ignore this event type and rely on its
                                handling of the `GET /events` request it will do immediately
                                after processing this batch of events.

                                Event sent to all the users whenever the Zulip server restarts.

                                Specifically, this event is sent whenever the Tornado process
                                for the user is restarted; in particular, this will always happen
                                when the Zulip server is upgraded.

                                Clients should use this event to update their tracking of the
                                server's capabilities, and to decide if they wish to get a new
                                event queue after a server upgrade. Clients doing so must
                                implement a random delay strategy to spread such restarts over 5
                                minutes or more to avoid creating a synchronized thundering herd
                                effect.

                                The more general of two event types that may be used when
                                sending an event to all users in a Zulip organization when
                                the configuration of the organization (realm) has changed.

                                Unlike the simpler [realm/update](#realm-update) event format, this
                                event type supports multiple properties being changed in a
                                single event.

                                **Changes**: In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 163), the realm setting
                                `email_address_visibility` was removed. It was replaced by a [user
                                setting](/api/update-settings#parameter-email_address_visibility) with
                                a [realm user default][user-defaults], with the encoding of different
                                values preserved. Clients can support all versions by supporting the
                                current API and treating every user as having the realm's
                                `email_address_visibility` value.

                                    **Changes**: In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 183), the
                                    `community_topic_editing_limit_seconds` property was removed.
                                    It was documented as potentially returned as a changed property
                                    in this event, but in fact it was only ever returned in the
                                    [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) response.

                                    Before Zulip 6.0 (feature level 150), on changing any of
                                    `allow_message_editing`, `message_content_edit_limit_seconds`, or
                                    `edit_topic_policy` settings, this object included all the three settings
                                    irrespective of which of these settings were changed. Now, a separate event
                                    is sent for each changed setting.

                                        organization.

                                        Clients should use this to implement server-settings UI to change which
                                        methods are enabled for the organization. For authentication UI itself,
                                        clients should use the pre-authentication metadata returned by
                                        [`GET /server_settings`](/api/get-server-settings).

                                        dictionary were changed. Previously, the values were a simple boolean
                                        indicating whether the backend is enabled or not.

                                        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 8.0 (feature level 195), a server bug meant
                                        that both `null` and an empty string could represent that no default was
                                        set for this realm setting in the [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue)
                                        response. The documentation for both that endpoint and this event
                                        incorrectly stated that the only representation for no default language
                                        was `null`. This event in fact uses the empty string to indicate that no
                                        default has been set in all server versions.

                      #### BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID errors

                      This error occurs if the target event queue has been garbage collected.
                      A compliant client will handle this error by re-initializing itself
                      (e.g. a Zulip web app browser window will reload in this case).

                      See [the /register endpoint docs](/api/register-queue) for details on how to
                      handle these correctly.

                      The following is the error response in such case:

      summary: Mark all messages as read

      description: |
        Marks all of the current user's unread messages as read.

        Because this endpoint marks messages as read in batches, it is possible
        for the request to time out after only marking some messages as read.
        When this happens, the `complete` boolean field in the success response
        will be `false`. Clients should repeat the request when handling such a
        response. If all messages were marked as read, then the success response
        will return `"complete": true`.

        **Changes**: Deprecated; clients should use the [update personal message
        flags for narrow](/api/update-message-flags-for-narrow) endpoint instead
        as this endpoint will be removed in a future release.

        Before Zulip 8.0 (feature level 211), if the server's
        processing was interrupted by a timeout, but some messages were marked
        as read, then it would return `"result": "partially_completed"`, along
        with a `code` field for an error string, in the success response to
        indicate that there was a timeout and that the client should repeat the
        request.

        Before Zulip 6.0 (feature level 153), this request did a single atomic
        operation, which could time out with 10,000s of unread messages to mark
        as read. As of this feature level, messages are marked as read in
        batches, starting with the newest messages, so that progress is made
        even if the request times out. And, instead of returning an error when
        the request times out and some messages have been marked as read, a
        success response with `"result": "partially_completed"` is returned.

        **Changes**: In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 184), moved support for
        [editing a scheduled message](/api/update-scheduled-message) to a
        separate API endpoint, which removed the `scheduled_message_id`
        parameter from this endpoint.

                    Note that, while `"private"` is supported for scheduling direct
                    messages, clients are encouraged to use to the modern convention of
                    `"direct"` to indicate this message type, because support for
                    `"private"` may eventually be removed.

                    **Changes**: In Zulip 9.0 (feature level 248), `"channel"` was added as
                    an additional value for this parameter to indicate the type of a stream

                    `"stream"`/`"channel"`, then the `topic` parameter is also required.

                    Note that, while `"private"` is supported for scheduling direct
                    messages, clients are encouraged to use to the modern convention of
                    `"direct"` to indicate this message type, because support for
                    `"private"` may eventually be removed.

                    **Changes**: In Zulip 9.0 (feature level 248), `"channel"` was added as
                    an additional value for this parameter to indicate the type of a stream
                    message.

        Fetch user's message history from a Zulip server.

        This endpoint is the primary way to fetch a user's message history
        from a Zulip server. It is useful both for Zulip clients (e.g. the
        web, desktop, mobile, and terminal clients) as well as bots, API
        clients, backup scripts, etc.

        Note that a user's message history does not contain messages sent to
        streams before they [subscribe](/api/subscribe), and newly created
        bot users are not usually subscribed to any streams.

        By specifying a [narrow filter](/api/get-messages#parameter-narrow),
        you can use this endpoint to fetch the messages matching any search
        query that is supported by Zulip's powerful full-text search backend.

        In either case, you specify an `anchor` message (or ask the server to
        calculate the first unread message for you and use that as the
        anchor), as well as a number of messages before and after the anchor
        message. The server returns those messages, sorted by message ID, as
        well as some metadata that makes it easy for a client to determine
        whether there are more messages matching the query that were not
        returned due to the `num_before` and `num_after` limits.

        We recommend setting `num_before` and `num_after` to no more than 1000, to
        avoid generating very large HTTP responses. A maximum of 5000 messages
        can be obtained per request; attempting to exceed this will result in an
        error.

            - `newest`: The most recent message.
            - `oldest`: The oldest message.
            - `first_unread`: The oldest unread message matching the
              query, if any; otherwise, the most recent message.

            **Changes**: String values are new in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1). The
            `first_unread` functionality was supported in Zulip 2.1.x
            and older by not sending `anchor` and using `use_first_unread_anchor`.

            In Zulip 2.1.x and older, `oldest` can be emulated with
            `"anchor": 0`, and `newest` with `"anchor": 10000000000000000`
            (that specific large value works around a bug in Zulip
            2.1.x and older in the `found_newest` return value).

            The narrow where you want to fetch the messages from. See how to
            [construct a narrow](/api/construct-narrow).

            Note that many narrows, including all that lack a `stream`
            or `streams` operator, search the user's personal message
            history. See [searching shared
            history](/help/search-for-messages#searching-shared-history)
            for details.

            For example, if you would like to fetch messages from all public streams instead
            of only the user's message history, then a specific narrow for
            messages sent to all public streams can be used:
            `{"operator": "streams", "operand": "public"}`.

            Newly created bot users are not usually subscribed to any
            streams, so bots using this API should either be
            subscribed to appropriate streams or use a shared history
            search narrow with this endpoint.

            **Changes**: In Zulip 9.0 (feature level 250), narrows gained support
            for two new filters related to stream messages: `channel` and `channels`;
            which are aliases for (and return the same results as) the `stream` and
            `streams` filters respectively.

            In Zulip 9.0 (feature level 249), narrows gained support for a new
            filter, `has:reaction`, which returns messages with at least one
            [emoji reaction](/help/emoji-reactions).

            In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 177), narrows gained support
            for three new filters related to direct messages: `is:dm`, `dm` and
            `dm-including`; replacing and deprecating `is:private`, `pm-with` and
            `group-pm-with` respectively.

            In Zulip 2.1.0, added support for using user/stream IDs when
            constructing narrows for a message's sender, its stream and/or
            its recipient(s).

                                    name for the `stream_wildcard_mentioned` flag as topic wildcard mentions
                                    were not available prior to this feature level.

                    In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 174), `"direct"` was added as
                    the preferred way to request a direct message, deprecating the original
                    `"private"`. While `"private"` is still supported for requesting direct
                    messages, clients are encouraged to use to the modern convention with
                    servers that support it, because support for `"private"` will eventually
                    be removed.
                  type: string
                  enum:

                    For stream messages, either the name or integer ID of the stream. For
                    direct messages, either a list containing integer user IDs or a list
                    containing string Zulip API email addresses.

                    **Changes**: Support for using user/stream IDs was added in Zulip 2.0.0.

                    The topic of the message. Only required for stream messages
                    (`"type": "stream"`), ignored otherwise.

                    Clients should use the `max_topic_length` returned by the
                    [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) endpoint to determine
                    the maximum topic length.

                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 2.0.0. Previous Zulip releases encoded
                    this as `subject`, which is currently a deprecated alias.
                  type: string

                queue_id:

                  description: |
                    For clients supporting
                    [local echo](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/sending-messages.html#local-echo),
                    the [event queue](/api/register-queue)
                    ID for the client. If passed, `local_id` is required. If the message is
                    successfully sent, the server will include `local_id` in the `message` event
                    that the client with this `queue_id` will receive notifying it of the new message
                    via [`GET /events`](/api/get-events). This lets the client know unambiguously
                    that it should replace the locally echoed message, rather than adding this new
                    message (which would be correct if the user had sent the new message from another
                    device).
                  example: "fb67bf8a-c031-47cc-84cf-ed80accacda8"
                local_id:
                  type: string

                    For clients supporting local echo, a unique string-format identifier
                    chosen freely by the client; the server will pass it back to the client without
                    inspecting it, as described in the `queue_id` description.
                  example: "100.01"
                read_by_sender:
                  type: boolean
                  description: |
                    Whether the message should be initially marked read by its
                    sender. If unspecified, the server uses a heuristic based
                    on the client name.

                        description: |
                          If the message's sender had configured their [visibility policy settings](/help/mute-a-topic)
                          to potentially automatically follow or unmute topics when sending messages,
                          and one of these policies did in fact change the user's visibility policy
                          for the topic where this message was sent, the new value for that user's
                          visibility policy for the recipient topic.

                          Only present if the sender's visibility was in fact changed.

                          The value can be either [unmuted or followed](/api/update-user-topic#parameter-visibility_policy).

                          Clients will also be notified about the change in policy via a
                          `user_topic` event as usual. This field is intended to be used by clients
                          to explicitly inform the user when a topic's visibility policy was changed
                          automatically due to sending a message.

                          For example, the Zulip web application uses this field to decide whether
                          to display a warning or notice suggesting to unmute the topic after
                          sending a message to a muted stream. Such a notice would be confusing in
                          the event that the act of sending the message had already resulted in the
                          user automatically unmuting or following the topic in question.

                          **Changes**: New in Zulip 8.0 (feature level 218).

                  description: |
                    The narrow you want update flags within. See how to
                    [construct a narrow](/api/construct-narrow).

                    Note that, when adding the `read` flag to messages, clients should
                    consider including a narrow with the `is:unread` filter as an
                    optimization. Including that filter takes advantage of the fact that
                    the server has a database index for unread messages.

                    **Changes**: In Zulip 9.0 (feature level 250), narrows gained support
                    for two new filters related to stream messages: `channel` and `channels`;
                    which are aliases for (and return the same results as) the `stream` and
                    `streams` filters respectively.

                    In Zulip 9.0 (feature level 249), narrows gained support for a new
                    filter, `has:reaction`, which returns messages with at least one
                    [emoji reaction](/help/emoji-reactions).

                    In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 177), narrows gained support
                    for three new filters related to direct messages: `is:dm`, `dm` and
                    `dm-including`; replacing and deprecating `is:private`, `pm-with` and
                    `group-pm-with` respectively.

        Returns a list containing the IDs for all users who have
        marked the message as read (and whose privacy settings allow
        sharing that information).

        The list of users IDs will include any bots who have marked
        the message as read via the API (providing a way for bots to
        indicate whether they have processed a message successfully in
        a way that can be easily inspected in a Zulip client). Bots
        for which this behavior is not desired may disable the
        `send_read_receipts` setting via the API.

        It will never contain the message's sender.

        **Changes**: New in Zulip 6.0 (feature level 137).

                      A typical JSON response when attempting to access read receipts for

      description: |
        Check whether a set of messages match a [narrow](/api/construct-narrow).

        For many common narrows (e.g. a topic), clients can write an efficient
        client-side check to determine whether a newly arrived message belongs
        in the view.

        This endpoint is designed to allow clients to handle more complex narrows
        for which the client does not (or in the case of full-text search, cannot)
        implement this check.

        The format of the `match_subject` and `match_content` objects is designed
        to match those returned by the [`GET /messages`](/api/get-messages#response)
        endpoint, so that a client can splice these fields into a `message` object
        received from [`GET /events`](/api/get-events#message) and end up with an
        extended message object identical to how a [`GET /messages`](/api/get-messages)
        request for the current narrow would have returned the message.

            **Changes**: In Zulip 9.0 (feature level 250), narrows gained support
            for two new filters related to stream messages: `channel` and `channels`;
            which are aliases for (and return the same results as) the `stream` and
            `streams` filters respectively.

            In Zulip 9.0 (feature level 249), narrows gained support for a new
            filter, `has:reaction`, which returns messages with at least one
            [emoji reaction](/help/emoji-reactions).

            In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 177), narrows gained support
            for three new filters related to direct messages: `is:dm`, `dm` and
            `dm-including`; replacing and deprecating `is:private`, `pm-with` and
            `group-pm-with` respectively.

        prefilling a message edit textarea).

        Edit/update the content, topic, or stream of a message.

        `{msg_id}` in the above URL should be replaced with the ID of the
        message you wish you update.

        You can [resolve topics](/help/resolve-a-topic) by editing the
        topic to `✔ {original_topic}`.

        See [configuring message editing][config-message-editing] for detailed
        documentation on when users are allowed to edit message content and
        [restricting moving messages][restrict-move-messages] for detailed
        documentation on when users are allowed to change a message's topic
        and/or stream.

        The relevant realm settings in the API that are related to the above
        linked documentation on when users are allowed to update messages are:

        - `allow_message_editing`
        - `edit_topic_policy`
        - `move_messages_between_streams_policy`
        - `message_content_edit_limit_seconds`
        - `move_messages_within_stream_limit_seconds`
        - `move_messages_between_streams_limit_seconds`

        More details about these realm settings can be found in the
        [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) response or in the documentation
        of the [`realm op: update_dict`](/api/get-events#realm-update_dict)
        event in [`GET /events`](/api/get-events).

        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 7.0 (feature level 172), anyone could add a
        topic to stream messages without a topic, regardless of the organization's
        [topic editing permissions](/help/restrict-moving-messages). As of this
        feature level, messages without topics have the same restrictions for
        topic edits as messages with topics.

        Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 172), by using the `change_all` value for
        the `propagate_mode` parameter, users could move messages after the
        organization's configured time limits for changing a message's topic or
        stream had passed. As of this feature level, the server will [return an
        error](/api/update-message#response) with `"code":
        "MOVE_MESSAGES_TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"` if users, other than organization
        administrators or moderators, try to move messages after these time
        limits have passed.

        Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 162), users who were not administrators or
        moderators could only edit topics if the target message was sent within the
        last 3 days. As of this feature level, that time limit is now controlled by
        the realm setting `move_messages_within_stream_limit_seconds`. Also at this
        feature level, a similar time limit for moving messages between streams was
        added, controlled by the realm setting
        `move_messages_between_streams_limit_seconds`. Previously, all users who
        had permission to move messages between streams did not have any time limit
        restrictions when doing so.

        Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 159), editing streams and topics of messages
        was forbidden if the realm setting for `allow_message_editing` was `false`,
        regardless of an organization's configuration for the realm settings
        `edit_topic_policy` or `move_messages_between_streams_policy`.

        Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 159), message senders were allowed to edit
        the topic of their messages indefinitely.

                    only the content of a message.

                    had a default of `true` and was ignored unless the stream was changed.

                          A special failed JSON response (`"code": "MOVE_MESSAGES_TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"`)
                          for when the user has permission to move
                          the target message, but asked to move all messages in a topic
                          (`"propagate_mode": "change_all"`) and the user does not have permission
                          to move the entire topic.

                          This happens when the topic contains some messages that are older than an
                          applicable time limit for the requested topic move (see
                          `move_messages_within_stream_limit_seconds` and/or
                          `move_messages_between_streams_limit_seconds` in the
                          [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) response).

                          The error response contains data on which portion of this topic the user has
                          permission to move. `first_message_id_allowed_to_move` is the oldest message
                          ID in this topic that the user has permission to move.
                          There are `total_messages_in_topic` in the topic, but the user only has
                          permission to move the (most recent) `total_messages_allowed_to_move`
                          messages.

                          Clients should support this error code with
                          `"first_message_id_allowed_to_move": null` for forward compatibility
                          with future server versions that may use this error code with other
                          propagation modes where the user does not have permission to move any
                          messages, or where the server did not calculate the total message counts
                          noted above.

                          Clients can either only present the error to the user or, if
                          `first_message_id_allowed_to_move` is not `null`, prompt the user to adjust
                          their query with the above information.

                          If clients choose to present a prompt for this error code, they should
                          recommend the option of cancelling and (manually) asking a moderator to
                          move the entire topic, since that's often a better experience than
                          partially moving a topic. This API supports a client that wishes to allow
                          the user to repeat the request with a `change_later` propagation mode and
                          a target message ID of `first_message_id_allowed_to_move`, if the user
                          desires to move only the portion of the topic that they can.

                          Note that in a stream with [protected history](/help/channel-permissions),
                          the Zulip security model requires that the above calculations only include
                          messages the acting user has access to. So in the rare case of a user
                          attempting to move a topic that started before the user joined a private
                          stream with protected history, this API endpoint might move only the portion
                          of a topic that they have access to, without this error or any confirmation
                          dialog.

        The maximum file size for uploads can be configured by the
        administrator of the Zulip server by setting `MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE`
        in the [server's settings][1]. `MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE` defaults
        to 25MB.

        !!! warn ""

            **Note**: On Zulip Cloud, this feature is available only for
            organizations on a [Zulip Cloud Standard](https://zulip.com/plans/)
            or [Zulip Cloud Plus](https://zulip.com/plans/) plan. Administrators
            can request the required `can_create_users` permission for a bot or
            user by contacting [Zulip Cloud support][support] with an
            explanation for why it is needed. Self-hosted installations can
            toggle `can_create_users` on an account using the `manage.py
            change_user_role` [management command][management-commands].

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 4.0 (feature level 36), this endpoint was
        available to all organization administrators.

        Get the presence status for a specific user.

        This endpoint is most useful for embedding data about a user's
        presence status in other sites (e.g. an employee directory). Full
        Zulip clients like mobile/desktop apps will want to use the [main
        presence endpoint](/api/get-presence), which returns data for all
        active users in the organization, instead.

        See [Zulip's developer documentation][subsystems-presence]
        for details on the data model for presence in Zulip.

                            presence.

                            **Changes**: Starting with Zulip 7.0 (feature level 178), this will always
                            contain two keys, `"website"` and `"aggregated"`, with identical data. The
                            server no longer stores which client submitted presence updates.

                            Previously, the `{client_name}` keys for these objects were the names of the
                            different clients where the user was logged in, for example `website` or
                            `ZulipDesktop`.

      description: |
        Change your [status](/help/status-and-availability).

        A request to this endpoint will only change the parameters passed.
        For example, passing just `status_text` requests a change in the status
        text, but will leave the status emoji unchanged.

        Clients that wish to set the user's status to a specific value should
        pass all supported parameters.

        **Changes**: In Zulip 5.0 (feature level 86), added support for
        `emoji_name`, `emoji_code`, and `reaction_type` parameters.

                  type: string
                  description: |
                    The text content of the status message. Sending the empty string
                    will clear the user's status.

                    **Note**: The limit on the size of the message is 60 characters.
                  example: on vacation
                away:
                  deprecated: true
                  type: boolean
                  description: |
                    Whether the user should be marked as "away".

                    **Changes**: Deprecated in Zulip 6.0 (feature level 148);
                    starting with that feature level, `away` is a legacy way to
                    access the user's `presence_enabled` setting, with
                    `away = !presence_enabled`. To be removed in a future release.
                  example: true
                emoji_name:
                  type: string
                  description: |
                    The name for the emoji to associate with this status.

                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 86).
                  example: car
                emoji_code:
                  type: string
                  description: |
                    A unique identifier, defining the specific emoji codepoint requested,
                    within the namespace of the `reaction_type`.

                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 86).
                  example: 1f697

                    A string indicating the type of emoji. Each emoji `reaction_type`
                    has an independent namespace for values of `emoji_code`.

                    Must be one of the following values:

                    - `unicode_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be a
                      dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
                      that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

                    - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
                      the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

                    - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Zulip.
                      In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.
                      "zulip").

                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 86).

        Subscribe one or more users to one or more streams.

        If any of the specified streams do not exist, they are automatically
        created. The initial [stream settings](/api/update-stream) will be determined
        by the optional parameters, like `invite_only`, detailed below.

        Note that the ability to subscribe oneself and/or other users to a specified
        stream depends on the [stream's privacy settings](/help/channel-permissions).

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 8.0 (feature level 208), if a user
        specified by the [`principals`][principals-param] parameter was
        a deactivated user, or did not exist, then an HTTP status code
        of 403 was returned with `code: "UNAUTHORIZED_PRINCIPAL"` in the
        error response. As of this feature level, an HTTP status code of
        400 is returned with `code: "BAD_REQUEST"` in the error response
        for these cases.

                    as such. When set to `false`, the response will be a 200 and any streams
                    where the request encountered an authorization error will be listed
                    in the `unauthorized` key.

                    to be enabled on the Zulip server in question, the organization

        Unsubscribe yourself or other users from one or more streams.

        In addition to managing the current user's subscriptions, this
        endpoint can be used to remove other users from streams. This
        is possible in 3 situations:

        - Organization administrators can remove any user from any
          stream.
        - Users can remove a bot that they own from any stream that
          the user [can access](/help/channel-permissions).
        - Users can unsubscribe any user from a stream if they [have
          access](/help/channel-permissions) to the stream and are a
          member of the [user group](/api/get-user-groups) specified
          by the [`can_remove_subscribers_group`][can-remove-parameter]
          for the stream.

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 8.0 (feature level 208), if a user
        specified by the [`principals`][principals-param] parameter was
        a deactivated user, or did not exist, then an HTTP status code
        of 403 was returned with `code: "UNAUTHORIZED_PRINCIPAL"` in the
        error response. As of this feature level, an HTTP status code of
        400 is returned with `code: "BAD_REQUEST"` in the error response
        for these cases.

        Before Zulip 8.0 (feature level 197),
        the `can_remove_subscribers_group` setting
        was named `can_remove_subscribers_group_id`.

        Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 161), the
        `can_remove_subscribers_group_id` for all streams was always
        the system group for organization administrators.

        Before Zulip 6.0 (feature level 145), users had no special
        privileges for managing bots that they own.

        Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 169), this endpoint
        returned an error if asked to mute a topic that was already muted
        or asked to unmute a topic that had not previously been muted.

        This endpoint can be used to update the visibility policy for the single
        stream and topic pair indicated by the parameters for a user.

        **Changes**: New in Zulip 7.0 (feature level 170). Previously,
        toggling whether a topic was muted or unmuted was managed by the

        [Mute a user](/help/mute-a-user) from the perspective of the requesting
        user. Messages sent by muted users will be automatically marked as read
        and hidden for the user who muted them.

        Muted users should be implemented by clients as follows:

        - The server will immediately mark all messages sent by the muted
          user as read. This will automatically clear any existing mobile
          push notifications related to the muted user.
        - The server will mark any new messages sent by the muted user as read
          for the requesting user's account, which prevents all email and mobile
          push notifications.
        - Clients should exclude muted users from presence lists or other UI
          for viewing or composing one-on-one direct messages. One-on-one direct
          messages sent by muted users should be hidden everywhere in the Zulip UI.
        - Stream messages and group direct messages sent by the muted
          user should avoid displaying the content and name/avatar,
          but should display that N messages by a muted user were
          hidden (so that it is possible to interpret the messages by
          other users who are talking with the muted user).
        - Group direct message conversations including the muted user
          should display muted users as "Muted user", rather than
          showing their name, in lists of such conversations, along with using
          a blank grey avatar where avatars are displayed.
        - Administrative/settings UI elements for showing "All users that exist
          on this stream or realm", e.g. for organization
          administration or showing stream subscribers, should display
          the user's name as normal.

        This endpoint is used to upload a custom emoji for use in the user's
        organization. Access to this endpoint depends on the
        [organization's configuration](https://zulip.com/help/custom-emoji#change-who-can-add-custom-emoji).
      x-parameter-description: |
        As described above, the image file to upload must be provided in the
        request's body.

        ## Maximum file size

        The maximum file size for uploads can be configured by the
        administrator of the Zulip server by setting `MAX_EMOJI_FILE_SIZE_MIB`
        in the [server's settings][1]. `MAX_EMOJI_FILE_SIZE_MIB` defaults
        to 5MB.

            The name that should be associated with the uploaded emoji image/gif.
            The emoji name can only contain letters, numbers, dashes, and spaces.
            Upper and lower case letters are treated the same, and underscores (\_)
            are treated the same as spaces (consistent with how the Zulip UI
            handles emoji).

        organization administrators, who can deactivate any custom emoji.

        Note that deactivated emoji will still be visible in old messages, reactions,
        user statuses and stream descriptions.

        HTTP status code of 400 when the emoji did not exist, instead of 404.

        Custom profile fields are displayed in Zulip UI widgets in order; this
        endpoint allows administrative settings UI to change the field ordering.

        This endpoint is used to implement the dragging feature described in the

                    For field type 3 (List of options), this attribute is a JSON dictionary
                    defining the choices and the order they will be displayed in the
                    dropdown UI for individual users to select an option.

                    At most 2 profile fields may have this property be true in a given
                    organization. The "Long text" [profile field types][profile-field-types]
                    profile field types cannot be selected to be displayed in profile summaries.

                    The "Person picker" profile field is also not supported, but that is likely to
                    be temporary.

                    Because the required property is mutable, clients cannot assume that a required
                    custom profile field has a value. The Zulip web application displays a prominent
                    banner to any user who has not set a value for a required field.

        Change the [default values of settings][new-user-defaults] for new users

        [personal preference settings](/api/update-settings) are supported.

        This feature can be invaluable for customizing Zulip's default
        settings for notifications or UI to be appropriate for how the
        organization is using Zulip. (Note that this only supports
        personal preference settings, like when to send push
        notifications or what emoji set to use, not profile or
        identity settings that naturally should be different for each user).

        Note that this endpoint cannot, at present, be used to modify
        settings for existing users in any way.

        **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 96). If any parameters
        sent in the request are not supported by this endpoint, an
        [`ignored_parameters_unsupported`][ignored-parameters] array will
        be returned in the JSON success response.

                    Whether to display the names of reacting users on a message.

                    When enabled, clients should display the names of reacting users, rather than
                    a count, for messages with few total reactions. The ideal cutoff may depend on
                    the space available for displaying reactions; the official web application
                    displays names when 3 or fewer total reactions are present with this setting
                    enabled.

        This endpoint is used to update the user's personal settings for the
        streams they are subscribed to, including muting, color, pinning, and
        per-stream notification settings.

        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 111), response
        object included the `subscription_data` in the the
        request. The endpoint now returns the more ergonomic
        [`ignored_parameters_unsupported`][ignored-parameters] array instead.

                          One of the stream properties described below:

                          - `"color"`: The hex value of the user's display color for the stream.

                          - `"is_muted"`: Whether the stream is [muted](/help/mute-a-channel).<br>
                            **Changes**: As of Zulip 6.0 (feature level 139), updating either
                            `"is_muted"` or `"in_home_view"` generates two [subscription update
                            events](/api/get-events#subscription-update), one for each property,
                            that are sent to clients. Prior to this feature level, updating either
                            property only generated a subscription update event for
                            `"in_home_view"`. <br>
                            **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 2.1.0, this feature was represented
                            by the more confusingly named `"in_home_view"` (with the
                            opposite value: `in_home_view=!is_muted`); for
                            backwards-compatibility, modern Zulip still accepts that property.

                          - `"pin_to_top"`: Whether to pin the stream at the top of the stream list.

                          - `"desktop_notifications"`: Whether to show desktop notifications
                            for all messages sent to the stream.

                          - `"audible_notifications"`: Whether to play a sound
                            notification for all messages sent to the stream.

                          - `"push_notifications"`: Whether to trigger a mobile push
                            notification for all messages sent to the stream.

                          - `"email_notifications"`: Whether to trigger an email
                            notification for all messages sent to the stream.

                          - `"wildcard_mentions_notify"`: Whether wildcard mentions trigger
                            notifications as though they were personal mentions in this stream.

                          If the property is `"color"`, then `value` is a string
                          representing the hex value of the user's display
                          color for the stream. For all other above properties,
                          `value` is a boolean.

        [linkifiers](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier) are matched in messages and topics.
        Useful when defining linkifiers with overlapping patterns.

        **Changes**: New in Zulip 8.0 (feature level 202). Before this feature level,
        linkifiers were always processed in order by ID, which meant users would
        need to delete and recreate them to reorder the list of linkifiers.

        expires.

        In Zulip 5.0 (feature level 96), the `invite_expires_in_days` parameter was
        added which specified the number of days before the invitation would expire.

        **Changes**: In Zulip 8.0 (feature level 209), added support for non-admin
        users [with permission](/help/restrict-account-creation#change-who-can-send-invitations)
        to use this endpoint. Previously, it was restricted to administrators only.

        In Zulip 6.0 (feature level 126), the `invite_expires_in_days`
        parameter was removed and replaced by `invite_expires_in_minutes`.

        In Zulip 5.0 (feature level 117), added support for passing `null` as
        the `invite_expires_in_days` parameter to request an invitation that never
        expires.

        In Zulip 5.0 (feature level 96), the `invite_expires_in_days` parameter was
        added which specified the number of days before the invitation would expire.

  /register:
    post:
      operationId: register-queue
      summary: Register an event queue
      tags: ["real_time_events"]
      description: |
        This powerful endpoint can be used to register a Zulip "event queue"
        (subscribed to certain types of "events", or updates to the messages
        and other Zulip data the current user has access to), as well as to
        fetch the current state of that data.

        (`register` also powers the `call_on_each_event` Python API, and is
        intended primarily for complex applications for which the more convenient
        `call_on_each_event` API is insufficient).

        This endpoint returns a `queue_id` and a `last_event_id`; these can be
        used in subsequent calls to the
        ["events" endpoint](/api/get-events) to request events from
        the Zulip server using long-polling.

        The server will queue events for up to 10 minutes of inactivity.
        After 10 minutes, your event queue will be garbage-collected. The
        server will send `heartbeat` events every minute, which makes it easy
        to implement a robust client that does not miss events unless the
        client loses network connectivity with the Zulip server for 10 minutes
        or longer.

        Once the server garbage-collects your event queue, the server will
        [return an error](/api/get-events#bad_event_queue_id-errors)
        with a code of `BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID` if you try to fetch events from
        the event queue. Your software will need to handle that error
        condition by re-initializing itself (e.g. this is what triggers your
        browser reloading the Zulip web app when your laptop comes back online
        after being offline for more than 10 minutes).

        When prototyping with this API, we recommend first calling `register`
        with no `event_types` parameter to see all the available data from all
        supported event types. Before using your client in production, you
        should set appropriate `event_types` and `fetch_event_types` filters
        so that your client only requests the data it needs. A few minutes
        doing this often saves 90% of the total bandwidth and other resources
        consumed by a client using this API.

        See the [events system developer documentation][events-system-docs]
        if you need deeper details about how the Zulip event queue system
        works, avoids clients needing to worry about large classes of
        potentially messy races, etc.

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 183), the
        `realm_community_topic_editing_limit_seconds` property
        was returned by the response. It was removed because it
        had not been in use since the realm setting
        `move_messages_within_stream_limit_seconds` was introduced
        in feature level 162.

        In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 163), the realm setting
        `email_address_visibility` was removed. It was replaced by a [user
        setting](/api/update-settings#parameter-email_address_visibility) with
        a [realm user default][user-defaults], with the encoding of different
        values preserved. Clients can support all versions by supporting the
        current API and treating every user as having the realm's
        `email_address_visibility` value.

                      notification settings for stream messages).
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 2.1.0. In earlier Zulip releases,
                      stream-level notification settings were simple booleans.

                    - `bulk_message_deletion`: Boolean for whether the client's
                      handler for the `delete_message` event type has been
                      updated to process the new bulk format (with a
                      `message_ids`, rather than a singleton `message_id`).
                      Otherwise, the server will send `delete_message` events
                      in a loop.
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 13). This
                      capability is for backwards-compatibility; it will be
                      required in a future server release.

                    - `user_avatar_url_field_optional`: Boolean for whether the
                      client required avatar URLs for all users, or supports
                      using `GET /avatar/{user_id}` to access user avatars. If the
                      client has this capability, the server may skip sending a
                      `avatar_url` field in the `realm_user` at its sole discretion
                      to optimize network performance. This is an important optimization
                      in organizations with 10,000s of users.
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 18).

                    - `stream_typing_notifications`: Boolean for whether the client
                      supports stream typing notifications.
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58). This capability is
                      for backwards-compatibility; it will be required in a
                      future server release.

                    - `user_settings_object`: Boolean for whether the client supports the modern
                      `user_settings` event type. If false, the server will additionally send the
                      legacy `update_global_notifications` and `update_display_settings` event
                      types.
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 89). This capability is for
                      backwards-compatibility; it will be removed in a future server release.
                      Because the feature level 89 API changes were merged together, clients can
                      safely make a request with this client capability and also request all three
                      event types (`user_settings`, `update_display_settings`,
                      `update_global_notifications`), and get exactly one copy of settings data on
                      any server version. Clients can then use the `zulip_feature_level` in the
                      `/register` response or the presence/absence of a `user_settings` key to
                      determine where to look for the data.

                    - `linkifier_url_template`: Boolean for whether the client accepts
                      [linkifiers][help-linkifiers] that use [RFC 6570][rfc6570] compliant
                      URL templates for linkifying matches. If false or unset, then the
                      `realm_linkifiers` array in the `/register` response will be empty
                      if present, and no `realm_linkifiers` [events][events-linkifiers]
                      will be sent to the client.
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 7.0 (feature level 176). This capability
                      is for backwards-compatibility.

                    - `user_list_incomplete`: Boolean for whether the client supports not having an
                      incomplete user database. If true, then the `realm_users` array in the `register`
                      response will not include data for inaccessible users and clients of guest users will
                      not receive `realm_user op:add` events for newly created users that are not accessible
                      to the current user. **Changes**: New in Zulip 8.0 (feature level 232). This
                      capability is for backwards-compatibility.

                          to the server (and thus receive presence updates from the server).

                          It is important for presence implementations to use both this and
                          `server_presence_offline_threshold_seconds` correctly, so that a Zulip
                          server can change these values to manage the trade-off between load and
                          freshness of presence data.

                          `linkifier_url_template` client capability was not required. The
                          requirement was added because linkifiers were updated to contain
                          a URL template instead of a URL format string, which was a not
                          backwards-compatible change.

                          servers on earlier feature levels via the legacy `realm_filters` property.

                          **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 7.0 (feature level 176), this was
                          an array of tuples, where each tuple described a linkifier. The first
                          element of the tuple was a string regex pattern which represented the
                          pattern to be linkified on matching, for example `"#(?P<id>[123])"`.
                          The second element was a URL format string that the pattern should be
                          linkified with. A URL format string for the above example would be
                          `"https://realm.com/my_realm_filter/%(id)s"`. And the third element
                          was the ID of the realm filter.

                          **Deprecated** in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 54), replaced by the
                          `realm_linkifiers` key.

                          A array of dictionaries where each dictionary describes one of the
                          streams that is visible to the user and the user has never been subscribed
                          to.

                          Important for clients containing UI where one can browse streams to subscribe
                          to.

                          A set of data structures describing the conversations containing
                          the 50000 most recent unread messages the user has received. This will usually
                          contain every unread message the user has received, but clients should support
                          users with even more unread messages (and not hardcode the number 50000).

                              Note that it is possible for a message that the current user sent
                              to the specified user to be marked as unread and thus appear here.

                                `reaction_type` has an independent namespace for values of `emoji_code`.

                                Must be one of the following values:

                                - `unicode_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be a
                                  dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
                                  that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

                                - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
                                  the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

                                - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Zulip.
                                  In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.
                                  "zulip").

                          these settings appeared in the top-level object, where they are
                          available for clients without the `user_settings_object` client

                              way for the user to configure this behavior on the web, and the Zulip web and
                              desktop apps behaved like the "Always" setting when marking messages as read.

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 245). Previously, font size was
                              only adjustable via browser zoom. Note that this setting was not fully
                              implemented at this feature level.

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 245). Previously, line height was

                              When enabled, clients should display the names of reacting
                              users, rather than a count, for messages with few total
                              reactions. The ideal cutoff may depend on the space
                              available for displaying reactions; the official web
                              application displays names when 3 or fewer total reactions
                              are present with this setting enabled.

                              The value needs to be a standard language code that the Zulip server has
                              translation data for; for example, `"en"` for English or `"de"` for German.

                                **Changes**: In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 219), added followed as
                                a visibility policy option.

                                In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 170), added unmuted as a visibility
                                policy option.

                          A boolean which signifies whether the user has a zoom token and has thus completed
                          OAuth flow for the [Zoom integration](/help/start-a-call). Clients need
                          to know whether initiating Zoom OAuth is required before creating a Zoom call.

                          GIPHY's client-side SDKs needs this API key to use the GIPHY API.
                          GIPHY API keys are not secret (their main purpose appears to be
                          allowing GIPHY to block a problematic app). Please don't use our API
                          key for an app unrelated to Zulip.

                          Developers of clients should also read the
                          [GIPHY API TOS](https://support.giphy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028134111-GIPHY-API-Terms-of-Service-)
                          before using this API key.

                          **Changes**: Added in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 47).

                          set for this realm setting. Clients supporting older server versions

                          eventually be removed. Previously, the Jitsi server to use was not
                          configurable on a per-realm basis, and this field contained the server's
                          configured Jitsi server. (Which is now provided as
                          `server_jitsi_server_url`). Clients supporting older versions should fall
                          back to this field when creating calls: using `realm_jitsi_server_url ||
                          server_jitsi_server_url` with newer servers and using `jitsi_server_url`
                          with servers below feature level 212.

                          Clients should use this to determine whether to offer UI for the

                          The data at the given URL is a JSON object with one property, `code_to_names`.
                          The value of that property is a JSON object where each key is an
                          [emoji code](/api/add-reaction#parameter-emoji_code) for an available
                          Unicode emoji, and each value is the corresponding

                          with the canonical name for the emoji always appearing first.

                          The HTTP response at that URL will have appropriate HTTP caching headers, such
                          any HTTP implementation should get a cached version if emoji haven't changed
                          since the last request.

                          This is guaranteed to be somewhat greater than the heartbeat frequency. It is important
                          that clients respect this parameter, so that increases in the heartbeat frequency do not

                          The ID of the stream to which automated messages announcing
                          new features or other end-user updates about the Zulip software are sent.

                          Will be `-1` if such automated messages are disabled.

                          Since these automated messages are sent by the server, this field is
                          primarily relevant to clients containing UI for changing it.

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 7.0 (feature level 175). Previously, there was no
                              way for the user to configure this behavior on the web, and the Zulip web and
                              desktop apps behaved like the "Always" setting when marking messages as read.

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 253). Previously, there were

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 245). Previously, font size was
                              only adjustable via browser zoom. Note that this setting was not fully
                              implemented at this feature level.

                              User-configured primary `line-height` for the web application, in percent, so a
                              value of 120 represents a `line-height` of 1.2.

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 245). Previously, line height was
                              not user-configurable. Note that this setting was not fully implemented at this
                              feature level.

                              Whether to display the names of reacting users on a message.

                              When enabled, clients should display the names of reacting
                              users, rather than a count, for messages with few total
                              reactions. The ideal cutoff may depend on the space
                              available for displaying reactions; the official web
                              application displays names when 3 or fewer total reactions
                              are present with this setting enabled.

                              This controls both the Zulip UI as well as email notifications sent to the user.

                              The value needs to be a standard language code that the Zulip server has
                              translation data for; for example, `"en"` for English or `"de"` for German.

                          `can_access_all_users_group` policy, and the event queue was registered
                          with the `user_list_incomplete` client capability, then users that the

                          capability, then that inaccessible user will appear in the users array as

        Please note that not all of these attributes are guaranteed to appear in a
        response, for two reasons:

        * This endpoint has evolved over time, so responses from older Zulip servers
          might be missing some keys (in which case a client should assume the
          appropriate default).
        * If a `/server_settings` request is made to the root domain of a
          multi-subdomain server, like the root domain of zulip.com, the settings
          that are realm-specific are not known and thus not provided.

        Fetch global settings for a Zulip server.

        **Note:** this endpoint does not require any authentication at all, and you can use it to check:

        - If this is a Zulip server, and if so, what version of Zulip it's running.
        - What a Zulip client (e.g. a mobile app or
          [zulip-terminal](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal/)) needs to
          know in order to display a login prompt for the server (e.g. what
          authentication methods are available).

                          a value of N means the server supports all API features introduced
                          before feature level N. This is designed to provide a simple way
                          for client apps to decide whether the server supports a given
                          feature or API change. See the [changelog](/api/changelog) for
                          details on what each feature level means.

        This endpoint is used to edit the current user's settings.

        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this
        endpoint only supported the `full_name`, `email`,
        `old_password`, and `new_password` parameters. Notification
        settings were managed by `PATCH /settings/notifications`, and
        all other settings by `PATCH /settings/display`.

        The feature level 80 migration to merge these endpoints did not
        change how request parameters are encoded. However, it did change
        the handling of any invalid parameters present in a request
        (see feature level 78 change below).

        The `/settings/display` and `/settings/notifications`
        endpoints are now deprecated aliases for this endpoint for
        backwards-compatibility, and will be removed once clients have
        migrated to use this endpoint.

        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 78),
        the `/settings` endpoint indicated which parameters it had
        processed by including in the response object `"key": value`
        entries for values successfully changed by the request. That
        was replaced by the more ergonomic
        [`ignored_parameters_unsupported`][ignored-parameters] array.

        The `/settings/notifications` and `/settings/display` endpoints
        also had this behavior before they became aliases of `/settings`
        in Zulip 5.0 (see feature level 80 change above).

        Before these changes, request parameters that were not supported
        (or were unchanged) were silently ignored.

                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 7.0 (feature level 175). Previously, there was no
                    way for the user to configure this behavior on the web, and the Zulip web and
                    desktop apps behaved like the "Always" setting when marking messages as read.

                    **Changes**: Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this setting was managed by
                    the `PATCH /settings/display` endpoint.

                    The server will only deliver typing notifications events to users who for whom this
                    is enabled.

                    By default, this is set to true, enabling user to receive typing
                    notifications from other users.

                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 253). Previously, there were only
                    options to disable sending typing notifications.

                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 245). Previously, font size was
                    only adjustable via browser zoom. Note that this setting was not fully
                    implemented at this feature level.

                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 245). Previously, line height was
                    not user-configurable. Note that this setting was not fully implemented at this
                    feature level.

                    Automatic detection is implementing using the standard `prefers-color-scheme`
                    media query.

                    A boolean parameter to control whether synchronizing drafts is enabled for
                    the user. When synchronization is disabled, all drafts stored in the server
                    will be automatically deleted from the server.

                    This does not do anything (like sending events) to delete local copies of
                    drafts stored in clients.

                    Whether to display the names of reacting users on a message.

                    When enabled, clients should display the names of reacting users, rather than
                    a count, for messages with few total reactions. The ideal cutoff may depend on
                    the space available for displaying reactions; the official web application
                    displays names when 3 or fewer total reactions are present with this setting
                    enabled.

                    This controls both the Zulip UI as well as email notifications sent to the user.

                    The value needs to be a standard language code that the Zulip server has
                    translation data for; for example, `"en"` for English or `"de"` for German.

                    the `PATCH /settings/display` endpoint.

                    Unnecessary JSON-encoding of this parameter was removed in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 63).

                    to be enabled on the Zulip server in question, the organization
                    to have enabled the `enable_spectator_access` realm setting, and
                    the current use to have permission under the organization's
                    `create_web_public_stream_policy` realm setting.

                    **Changes**: Before Zulip 6.0 (feature level 136), `history_public_to_subscribers`
                    was silently ignored unless the request also contained either `is_private` or

                      An example JSON response for when the requested stream does not exist,
                      or where the user does not have permission to access the target stream:
  /streams/{stream_id}/delete_topic:

      operationId: delete-topic
      summary: Delete a topic
      tags: ["streams"]
      description: |
        Delete all messages in a topic.

        Topics are a field on messages (not an independent data structure), so
        deleting all the messages in the topic deletes the topic from Zulip.

        Because this endpoint deletes messages in batches, it is possible for
        the request to time out after only deleting some messages in the topic.
        When this happens, the `complete` boolean field in the success response
        will be `false`. Clients should repeat the request when handling such a
        response. If all messages in the topic were deleted, then the success
        response will return `"complete": true`.

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 9.0 (feature level 256), the server never sent
        events updating the `first_message_id` for a stream when the oldest
        message that had been sent to it changed.

        Before Zulip 8.0 (feature level 211), if the server's
        processing was interrupted by a timeout, but some messages in the topic
        were deleted, then it would return `"result": "partially_completed"`,
        along with a `code` field for an error string, in the success response
        to indicate that there was a timeout and that the client should repeat
        the request.

        As of Zulip 6.0 (feature level 154), instead of returning an error
        response when a request times out after successfully deleting some of
        the messages in the topic, a success response is returned with
        `"result": "partially_completed"` to indicate that some messages were
        deleted.

        Before Zulip 6.0 (feature level 147), this request did a single atomic
        operation, which could time out for very large topics. As of this
        feature level, messages are deleted in batches, starting with the newest
        messages, so that progress is made even if the request times out and
        returns an error.

        Notify other users whether the current user is
        [typing a message][help-typing].

        Clients implementing Zulip's typing notifications
        protocol should work as follows:

        - Send a request to this endpoint with `"op": "start"` when a user
          starts composing a message.
        - While the user continues to actively type or otherwise interact with
          the compose UI (e.g. interacting with the compose box emoji picker),
          send regular `"op": "start"` requests to this endpoint, using
          `server_typing_started_wait_period_milliseconds` in the
          [`POST /register`][api-register] response as the time interval
          between each request.
        - Send a request to this endpoint with `"op": "stop"` when a user
          has stopped using the compose UI for the time period indicated by
          `server_typing_stopped_wait_period_milliseconds` in the
          [`POST /register`][api-register] response or when a user
          cancels the compose action (if it had previously sent a "start"
          notification for that compose action).
        - Start displaying a visual typing indicator for a given conversation
          when a [`typing op:start`][start-typing] event is received
          from the server.
        - Continue displaying a visual typing indicator for the conversation
          until a [`typing op:stop`][stop-typing] event is received
          from the server or the time period indicated by
          `server_typing_started_expiry_period_milliseconds` in the
          [`POST /register`][api-register] response has passed without
          a new `typing "op": "start"` event for the conversation.

        This protocol is designed to allow the server-side typing notifications
        implementation to be stateless while being resilient as network failures
        will not result in a user being incorrectly displayed as perpetually
        typing.

        See the subsystems documentation on [typing indicators][typing-protocol-docs]
        for additional design details on Zulip's typing notifications protocol.

        **Changes**: Clients shouldn't care about the APIs prior to Zulip 8.0 (feature level 215)
        for stream typing notifications, as no client actually implemented
        the previous API for those.

        Support for displaying stream typing notifications was new
        in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58). Clients should indicate they support
        processing stream typing notifications via the `stream_typing_notifications`
        value in the `client_capabilities` parameter of the
        [`POST /register`][client-capabilities] endpoint.

                    an additional value for this parameter to indicate a stream message is
                    being composed.

                    In Zulip 8.0 (feature level 215), stopped supporting
                    `"private"` as a valid value for this parameter.

                    In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 174), `"direct"` was added
                    as the preferred way to indicate a direct message is being composed,
                    becoming the default value for this parameter and deprecating the
                    original `"private"`.

                    New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58). Previously, typing notifications

                    list of user IDs. (Use a list even if there is only one recipient.)

                    **Changes**: In Zulip 8.0 (feature level 215), stopped using this parameter
                    for the `"stream"` type. Previously, in the case of the `"stream"` type, it
                    accepted a single-element list containing the ID of the stream. A new parameter,
                    `stream_id`, is now used for this.

                    Support for typing notifications for stream messages
                    is new in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58). Previously, typing
                    notifications were only for direct messages.

                    Before Zulip 2.0.0, this parameter accepted only a JSON-encoded
                    list of email addresses. Support for the email address-based format was
                    removed in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 11).

                The average number of messages sent to the stream per week, as
                estimated based on recent weeks, rounded to the nearest integer.

                If `null`, no information is provided on the average traffic.
                This can be because the stream was recently created and there
                is insufficient data to make an estimate, or because the server
                wishes to omit this information for this client, this realm, or
                this endpoint or type of event.

            policy](/help/message-retention-policy). There are two special values:

            - `null`, the default, means the stream will inherit the organization
              level setting.

            Currently always true for public streams (i.e. `"invite_only": false` implies
            `"history_public_to_subscribers": true`), but clients should not make that
            assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.

            Intended to help clients determine whether they need to display
            UI like the "more topics" widget that would suggest the stream
            has older history that can be accessed.

            Is `null` for streams with no message history.

            the `can_remove_subscribers_group` setting
            was named `can_remove_subscribers_group_id`.

            (not animated) version of the emoji can be found. (This is
            currently always the first frame of the animation).

            This is useful for clients to display the emoji in contexts
            where continuously animating it would be a bad user experience
            (E.g. because it would be distracting).

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (added as optional field in
            feature level 97 and then made mandatory, but nullable, in
            feature level 113).

            exactly one variable named `code`, which determines how the
            extracted code should be substituted in the playground URL.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 8.0 (feature level 196). This replaced the
            `url_prefix` parameter, which was used to construct URLs by just
            concatenating url_prefix and code.

          description: |
            Array containing the ID of the direct_subgroups of
            this user group.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 6.0 (feature level 131).
            Introduced in feature level 127 as `subgroups`, but
            clients can ignore older events as this feature level
            predates subgroups being fully implemented.

            New in Zulip 8.0 (feature level 191). Previously, groups
            could be mentioned if and only if they were not system groups.

            Note that email invitations and reusable invitation links are stored
            in different database tables on the server, so each ID is guaranteed
            to be unique in combination with the boolean value of `is_multiuse`,
            e.g. there can only be one invitation with `id: 1` and `is_multiuse:
            true`.

            field which contained the Zulip display email address of the user who
            created the invitation.

    InviteExpirationParameter:
      description: |
        The number of minutes before the invitation will expire. If `null`, the
        invitation will never expire. If unspecified, the server will use a default
        value (based on the `INVITATION_LINK_VALIDITY_MINUTES` server setting, which
        defaults to 14400, i.e. 10 days) for when the invitation will expire.

        **Changes**: New in Zulip 6.0 (feature level 126). Previously, there was an
        `invite_expires_in_days` parameter, which specified the duration in days instead
        of minutes.
      type: integer
      nullable: true
      example: 14400
    InviteRoleParameter:

        - 300 = Organization moderator
        - 400 = Member
        - 600 = Guest

        Users can only create invitation links for
        [roles with equal or stricter restrictions](/api/roles-and-permissions#permission-levels)
        as their own. For example, a moderator cannot invite someone to be an owner
        or administrator, but they can invite them to be a moderator or member.

        **Changes**: In Zulip 4.0 (feature level 61), added support for inviting
        users as moderators.

            be used when displaying the stream description in a UI.

            One should use the standard Zulip rendered_markdown CSS when
            displaying this content so that emoji, LaTeX, and other syntax
            work correctly. And any client-side security logic for
            user-generated message content should be applied when displaying

            A `null` value means the stream has no recorded creator, which is often
            because the stream is very old, or because it was created via a data
            import tool or [management command][management-commands].

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 254).

            not count towards your total unread count and do not show
            up in the `Combined feed` view (previously known as `All messages`).

            **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 2.1.0, this feature was
            represented by the more confusingly named `in_home_view` (with the
            opposite value, `in_home_view=!is_muted`).

            before being automatically deleted by the [message retention
            policy](/help/message-retention-policy). There are two special values:

            - `null`, the default, means the stream will inherit the organization
              level setting.
            - `-1` encodes retaining messages in this stream forever.

          description: |
            Whether the history of the stream is public to its subscribers.

            Currently always true for public streams (i.e. `"invite_only": false` implies
            `"history_public_to_subscribers": true`), but clients should not make that
            assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.

            Intended to help clients determine whether they need to display
            UI like the "more topics" widget that would suggest the stream
            has older history that can be accessed.

            estimated based on recent weeks, rounded to the nearest integer.

            If `null`, the stream was recently created and there is

            the `can_remove_subscribers_group` setting
            was named `can_remove_subscribers_group_id`.

            If `null`, then the sender has not uploaded an avatar in Zulip,

            depending on whether the stream, topic, and/or message
            content were modified in the edit event. For example, if
            only the topic was edited, only `prev_topic` and `topic`

          description: |
            A boolean specifying whether the user is a bot or full account.
        bot_type:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            An integer describing the type of bot:

            - `null` if the user isn't a bot.
            - `1` for a `Generic` bot.
            - `2` for an `Incoming webhook` bot.
            - `3` for an `Outgoing webhook` bot.
            - `4` for an `Embedded` bot.
        bot_owner_id:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            If the user is a bot (i.e. `is_bot` is true), then `bot_owner_id`
            is the user ID of the bot's owner (usually, whoever created the bot).

            Will be `null` for legacy bots that do not have an owner.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1). In previous
            versions, there was a `bot_owner` field containing the email
            address of the bot's owner.

        avatar_url:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          description: |
            URL for the user's avatar.

            Will be `null` if the `client_gravatar`
            query parameter was set to `true`, the current user has access to
            this user's real email address, and this user's avatar is hosted by
            the Gravatar provider (i.e. this user has never uploaded an avatar).

            **Changes**: Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 163), access to a
            user's real email address was a realm-level setting. As of this
            feature level, `email_address_visibility` is a user setting.

            In Zulip 3.0 (feature level 18), if the client has the
            `user_avatar_url_field_optional` capability, this will be missing at
            the server's sole discretion.

            Version for the user's avatar. Used for cache-busting requests
            for the user's avatar. Clients generally shouldn't need to use this;
            most avatar URLs sent by Zulip will already end with `?v={avatar_version}`.

        maps the integer ID of a custom profile field in the organization to a
        dictionary containing the user's data for that field. Generally the data
        includes just a single `value` key; for those custom profile fields
        supporting Markdown, a `rendered_value` key will also be present.

        endpoint, a successful JSON response will include an
        [`ignored_parameters_unsupported`][ignored_params] array.

        **Changes**: The [`ignored_parameters_unsupported`][ignored_params]
        array was added as a possible return value for all REST API endpoint
        JSON success responses in Zulip 7.0 (feature level 167).

        Previously, it was added to
        [`POST /users/me/subscriptions/properties`](/api/update-subscription-settings)
        in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 111) and to
        [`PATCH /realm/user_settings_defaults`](/api/update-realm-user-settings-defaults)
        in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 96). The feature was introduced in Zulip 5.0
        (feature level 78) as a return value for the
        [`PATCH /settings`](/api/update-settings) endpoint.

        A typical successful JSON response with ignored parameters may look like:

            the client must wait before making additional requests.

            Zulip sets a few [HTTP response headers][rate-limit-headers]
            to help with preventing rate limit errors.

            **Changes**: The `code` field was not present in rate
            limit errors before Zulip 4.0 (feature level 36).

            A typical failed JSON response for when a rate limit is exceeded:

    Event_types:
      description: |
        A JSON-encoded array indicating which types of events you're interested
        in. Values that you might find useful include:

        - **message** (messages)
        - **subscription** (changes in your subscriptions)
        - **realm_user** (changes to users in the organization and
          their properties, such as their name).

        If you do not specify this parameter, you will receive all
        events, and have to filter out the events not relevant to
        your client in your client code. For most applications, one
        is only interested in messages, so one specifies:
        `"event_types": ["message"]`

        Event types not supported by the server are ignored, in order to simplify
        the implementation of client apps that support multiple server versions.
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
      example: ["message"]
    Narrow:
      description: |
        A JSON-encoded array of arrays of length 2 indicating the
        [narrow filter(s)](/api/construct-narrow) for which you'd
        like to receive events for.

        For example, to receive events for direct messages (including
        group direct messages) received by the user, one can use
        `"narrow": [["is", "dm"]]`.

        Unlike the API for [fetching messages](/api/get-messages),
        this narrow parameter is simply a filter on messages that the
        user receives through their stream subscriptions (or because
        they are a recipient of a direct message).

        This means that a client that requests a `narrow` filter of
        `[["stream", "Denmark"]]` will receive events for new messages
        sent to that stream while the user is subscribed to that
        stream. The client will not receive any message events at all
        if the user is not subscribed to `"Denmark"`.

        Newly created bot users are not usually subscribed to any
        streams, so bots using this API need to be
        [subscribed](/api/subscribe) to any streams whose messages
        you'd like them to process using this endpoint.

        See the `all_public_streams` parameter for how to process all
        public stream messages in an organization.

        **Changes**: In Zulip 9.0 (feature level 250), narrows gained support
        for two new filters related to stream messages: `channel` and `channels`;
        which are aliases for (and return the same results as) the `stream` and
        `streams` filters respectively.

        In Zulip 9.0 (feature level 249), narrows gained support for a new
        filter, `has:reaction`, which returns messages with at least one
        [emoji reaction](/help/emoji-reactions).

        In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 177), narrows gained support
        for three new filters related to direct messages: `is:dm`, `dm` and
        `dm-including`; replacing and deprecating `is:private`, `pm-with` and
        `group-pm-with` respectively.

    RequiredContent:
      description: |
        The content of the message.

        Clients should use the `max_message_length` returned by the
        [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) endpoint to determine
        the maximum message size.
      type: string

        Clients should use the `max_message_length` returned by the

        the maximum message size.

        Note that a message's content and stream cannot be changed at the
        same time, so sending both `content` and `stream_id` parameters will
        throw an error.

    ReactionType:
      description: |
        A string indicating the type of emoji. Each emoji `reaction_type`
        has an independent namespace for values of `emoji_code`.

        If an API client is adding/removing a vote on an existing reaction,
        it should pass this parameter using the value the server provided
        for the existing reaction for specificity. Supported values:

        - `unicode_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be a
          dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
          that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

        - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
          the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

        - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Zulip.
          In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.
          "zulip").

        **Changes**: In Zulip 3.0 (feature level 2), this parameter became
        optional for [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji);
        previously, this endpoint assumed `unicode_emoji` if this
        parameter was not specified.
      type: string
      example: "unicode_emoji"
    EmojiCode:
      description: |
        A unique identifier, defining the specific emoji codepoint requested,
        within the namespace of the `reaction_type`.

        For most API clients, you won't need this, but it's important
        for Zulip apps to handle rare corner cases when
        adding/removing votes on an emoji reaction added previously by
        another user.

        If the existing reaction was added when the Zulip server was
        using a previous version of the emoji data mapping between
        Unicode codepoints and human-readable names, sending the
        `emoji_code` in the data for the original reaction allows the
        Zulip server to correctly interpret your upvote as an upvote
        rather than a reaction with a "different" emoji.

      example: "1f419"
    MessageRetentionDays:
      description: |
        Number of days that messages sent to this stream will be stored
        before being automatically deleted by the [message retention
        policy](/help/message-retention-policy). Two special string format
        values are supported:

        - `"realm_default"`: Return to the organization-level setting.
        - `"unlimited"`: Retain messages forever.

        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 91), retaining
        messages forever was encoded using `"forever"` instead of
        `"unlimited"`.

        New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 17).

    CanRemoveSubscribersGroupId:
      description: |
        ID of the [user group](/api/get-user-groups) whose members are
        allowed to unsubscribe others from the stream. Note that a user
        who is a member of the specified user group must also [have
        access](/help/channel-permissions) to the stream in order to
        unsubscribe others.

        This setting can currently only be set to user groups that are
        system groups, except for the system groups named
        `"role:internet"` and `"role:owners"`.

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 8.0 (feature level 197),
        the `can_remove_subscribers_group` setting
        was named `can_remove_subscribers_group_id`.

        If you used named groups in `pattern`, you can insert their
        content here with `{name_of_group}`.

        **Changes**: New in Zulip 7.0 (feature level 176). This replaced
        the `url_format_string` parameter, which was a format string in which
        named groups' content could be inserted with `%(name_of_group)s`.
