      summary: Fetch an API key (production)
      tags: ["authentication"]
      description: |
        This API endpoint is used by clients such as the Zulip mobile and
        terminal apps to implement password-based authentication. Given the
        user's Zulip login credentials, it returns a Zulip API key that the client
        can use to make requests as the user.

        This endpoint is only useful for Zulip servers/organizations with
        EmailAuthBackend or LDAPAuthBackend enabled.

        The Zulip mobile apps also support SSO/social authentication (GitHub
        auth, Google auth, SAML, etc.) that does not use this endpoint. Instead,
        the mobile apps reuse the web login flow passing the `mobile_flow_otp` in
        a webview, and the credentials are returned to the app (encrypted) via a redirect
        to a `zulip://` URL.

        !!! warn ""

            **Note:** If you signed up using passwordless authentication and
            never had a password, you can [reset your password](/help/change-your-password).

        See the [API keys](/api/api-keys) documentation for more details
        on how to download an API key manually.

        For easy testing of mobile apps and other clients and against Zulip
        development servers, we support fetching a Zulip API key for any user
        on the development server without authentication (so that they can
        implement analogues of the one-click login process available for Zulip
        development servers on the web).

      description: |
        This endpoint allows you to receive new events from
        [a registered event queue](/api/register-queue).

        Long-lived clients should use the
        `event_queue_longpoll_timeout_seconds` property returned by
        `POST /register` as the client-side HTTP request timeout for
        calls to this endpoint. It is guaranteed to be higher than
        heartbeat frequency and should be respected by clients to
        avoid breaking when heartbeat frequency increases.

            `POST /register` endpoint, you could pass the parameters for
            [the `POST /register` endpoint](/api/register-queue) to this
            endpoint and a queue would be registered in the absence of a `queue_id`.

                                    Clients should generally handle an unknown property received here without
                                    crashing, since that will naturally happen when connecting to a Zulip
                                    server running a new version that adds a new subscription property.

                                    **Changes**: As of Zulip 6.0 (feature level 139), updates to the `is_muted`
                                    property or the deprecated `in_home_view` property will send two `subscription`
                                    update events, one for each property, to support clients fully migrating to
                                    use the `is_muted` property. Prior to this feature level, updates to either
                                    property only sent one event with the deprecated `in_home_view` property.

                                    One should use the standard Zulip rendered_markdown CSS when

                                    work correctly. And any client-side security logic for
                                    user-generated message content should be applied when displaying
                                    this HTML as though it were the body of a Zulip message.

                                    **Changes**: As of Zulip 5.0 (feature level 114), this field
                                    is present for all `update_message` events. Previously, this
                                    field was omitted for [inline URL preview][inline-url-previews]
                                    updates.
                                rendering_only:

                                    Whether the event only updates the rendered content of the message.

                                    This field should be used by clients to determine if the event
                                    only provides a rendering update to the message content,
                                    such as for an [inline URL preview][inline-url-previews].
                                    When `True`, the event does not reflect a user-generated edit
                                    and does not modify the message history.

                                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 114). Clients can
                                    correctly identify these rendering update event with earlier
                                    Zulip versions by checking whether the `user_id` field was omitted.
                                message_id:
                                  type: integer

                                    The ID of the message which was edited or updated.

                                    This field should be used to apply content edits to the client's
                                    cached message history, or to apply rendered content updates.

                                    If the stream or topic was changed, the set of moved messages is
                                    encoded in the separate `message_ids` field, which is guaranteed
                                    to include `message_id`.
                                message_ids:
                                  type: array

                                    The list of IDs of messages to which any stream or topic changes
                                    encoded in this event should be applied.

                                    These messages are guaranteed to have all been previously sent
                                    to stream `stream_id` with topic `orig_subject`, and have been
                                    moved to `new_stream_id` with topic `subject` (if those fields
                                    are present in the event).

                                    Clients processing these events should update all cached message
                                    history associated with the moved messages (including adjusting
                                    `unread_msgs` data structures, where the client may not have the
                                    message itself in its history) to reflect the new stream and
                                    topic.

                                    Content changes should be applied only to the single message
                                    indicated by `message_id`.

                                    The choice the editing user made about which messages should be
                                    affected by a stream/topic edit:

                                    - `change_one` => Just change the one indicated in `message_id`.
                                    - `change_later` => Change messages in the same topic that had
                                      been sent after this one.
                                    - `change_all`=> Change all messages in that topic.

                                    This parameter should be used to decide whether to change
                                    navigation and compose box state in response to the edit. For
                                    example, if the user was previously in topic narrow, and the
                                    topic was edited with `change_later` or `change_all`, the Zulip
                                    web app will automatically navigate to the new topic narrow.
                                    Similarly, a message being composed to the old topic should
                                    have its recipient changed to the new topic.

                                    This navigation makes it much more convenient to move content
                                    between topics without disruption or messages continuing
                                    to be sent to the pre-edit topic by accident.

                                Event sent when a user stops typing a message.

                                Sent to all clients for users who would receive the message
                                that was previously being typed, with the additional rule
                                that typing notifications for stream messages are only sent to
                                clients that included `stream_typing_notifications` in their
                                `client_capabilities` when registering the event queue.

                                for the organization has changed.

                                Processing this event is important to doing Markdown local echo

                                backwards compatibility reasons.

                                Clients should migrate to requesting and processing the
                                `realm_linkifiers` event type when possible, since we plan to remove
                                the legacy `realm_filters` logic entirely in a future release.

                                the `realm_linkifiers` event type, which has a clearer name and format,
                                instead.

                                    The first element of the tuple is a
                                    string regex pattern which represents the pattern that should
                                    be linkified on matching. The second element is the URL with which the
                                    pattern matching string should be linkified with and the third element
                                    is the ID of the realm filter.

                                in a Zulip organization when the configuration of the
                                organization (realm) has changed.

                                Often individual settings are migrated from this format to
                                the [realm/update_dict](#realm-update_dict) event format when additional realm
                                settings are added whose values are coupled to each other
                                in some way. The specific values supported by this event
                                type are documented in the [realm/update_dict](#realm-update_dict)
                                documentation.

                                A correct client implementation should convert these
                                events into the corresponding [realm/update_dict](#realm-update_dict)
                                event and then process that.

                                Event sent to all users in a Zulip organization when the
                                organization (realm) is deactivated. Its main purpose is to
                                flush active longpolling connections so clients can immediately
                                show the organization as deactivated.

                                Clients cannot rely on receiving this event, because they will
                                no longer be able to authenticate to the Zulip API due to the
                                deactivation, and thus can miss it if they did not have an active
                                longpolling connection at the moment of deactivation.

                                Correct handling of realm deactivations requires that clients
                                parse authentication errors from GET /events; if that is done
                                correctly, the client can ignore this event type and rely on its
                                handling of the `GET /events` request it will do immediately
                                after processing this batch of events.

                                Specifically, this event is sent whenever the Tornado process
                                for the user is restarted; in particular, this will always happen
                                when the Zulip server is upgraded.

                                Clients can use this event to know when they should get a new
                                event queue after a server upgrade. Clients doing so must implement
                                a random delay strategy to spread such restarts over 10 minutes or
                                more to avoid creating a synchronized thundering herd effect.

                                    Clients can safely avoid refetching their state and
                                    creating a new event queue when the API feature level has not
                                    changed, or when they know the specific feature level change
                                    is not relevant to the client (E.g. it just adds a new endpoint
                                    that the client doesn't use).

                      #### BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID errors

                      This error occurs if the target event queue has been garbage collected.
                      A compliant client will handle this error by re-initializing itself
                      (e.g. a Zulip web app browser window will reload in this case).

                      See [the /register endpoint docs](/api/register-queue) for details on how to
                      handle these correctly.

                      The following is the error response in such case:

      description: |
        Marks all of the current user's unread messages as read.

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 6.0 (feature level 153), this
        request did a single atomic operation, which could time out
        with 10,000s of unread messages to mark as read.

        It now marks messages as read in batches, starting with the
        newest messages, so that progress will be made even if the
        request times out.

        If the server's processing is interrupted by a timeout, it
        will return an HTTP 200 success response with result
        "partially_completed". A correct client should repeat the
        request when handling such a response.
      responses:
        "200":

        Fetch user's message history from a Zulip server.

        This endpoint is the primary way to fetch a user's message history
        from a Zulip server. It is useful both for Zulip clients (e.g. the
        web, desktop, mobile, and terminal clients) as well as bots, API
        clients, backup scripts, etc.

        Note that a user's message history does not contain messages sent to
        streams before they [subscribe](/api/subscribe), and newly created
        bot users are not usually subscribed to any streams.

        By specifying a [narrow filter](/api/get-messages#parameter-narrow),
        you can use this endpoint to fetch the messages matching any search
        query that is supported by Zulip's powerful full-text search backend.

        In either case, you specify an `anchor` message (or ask the server to
        calculate the first unread message for you and use that as the
        anchor), as well as a number of messages before and after the anchor
        message. The server returns those messages, sorted by message ID, as
        well as some metadata that makes it easy for a client to determine
        whether there are more messages matching the query that were not
        returned due to the `num_before` and `num_after` limits.

        We recommend using `num_before <= 1000` and `num_after <= 1000` to
        avoid generating very large HTTP responses. A maximum of 5000 messages
        can be obtained per request; attempting to exceed this will result in an
        error.

            string values for when the client wants the server to compute the anchor
            to use:

            - `newest`: The most recent message.
            - `oldest`: The oldest message.
            - `first_unread`: The oldest unread message matching the
              query, if any; otherwise, the most recent message.

            **Changes**: String values are new in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1). The
            `first_unread` functionality was supported in Zulip 2.1.x
            and older by not sending `anchor` and using `use_first_unread_anchor`.

            In Zulip 2.1.x and older, `oldest` can be emulated with
            `anchor=0`, and `newest` with `anchor=10000000000000000`
            (that specific large value works around a bug in Zulip
            2.1.x and older in the `found_newest` return value).

            The narrow where you want to fetch the messages from. See how to
            [construct a narrow](/api/construct-narrow).

            Note that many narrows, including all that lack a `stream`
            or `streams` operator, search the user's personal message
            history. See [searching shared
            history](/help/search-for-messages#searching-shared-history)
            for details.

            For example, if you would like to fetch messages from all public streams instead
            of only the user's message history, then a specific narrow for
            messages sent to all public streams can be used:
            `{"operator": "streams", "operand": "public"}`.

            Newly created bot users are not usually subscribed to any
            streams, so bots using this API should either be
            subscribed to appropriate streams or use a shared history
            search narrow with this endpoint.

            **Changes**: In Zulip 2.1.0, added support for using user/stream IDs
            when constructing narrows for a message's sender, its stream and/or
            its recipient(s).

            the [event queue](/api/register-queue)
            ID for the client. If passed, `local_id` is required. If the message is
            successfully sent, the server will include `local_id` in the `message` event
            that the client with this `queue_id` will receive notifying it of the new message
            via [`GET /events`](/api/get-events). This lets the client know unambiguously
            that it should replace the locally echoed message, rather than adding this new
            message (which would be correct if the user had sent the new message from another
            device).

        The list of users IDs will include any bots who have marked

        indicate whether they have processed a message successfully in

        `send_read_receipts` setting via the API.

        It will never contain the message's sender.

      description: |
        Check whether a set of messages match a [narrow](/api/construct-narrow).

        For many common narrows (e.g. a topic), clients can write an efficient
        client-side check to determine whether a newly arrived message belongs
        in the view.

        This endpoint is designed to allow clients to handle more complex narrows
        for which the client does not (or in the case of full-text search, cannot)
        implement this check.

        The format of the `match_subject` and `match_content` objects is designed
        to match those returned by the [`GET /messages`](/api/get-messages#response)
        endpoint, so that a client can splice these fields into a `message` object
        received from [`GET /events`](/api/get-events#message) and end up with an
        extended message object identical to how a [`GET /messages`](/api/get-messages)
        request for the current narrow would have returned the message.

        useful for clients that primarily work with HTML-rendered
        messages but might need to occasionally fetch the message's
        raw Markdown (e.g. for [view

        prefilling a message edit textarea).

        uploaded file, you'll need to [send a message][send-message]
        containing the resulting link. Users who can already access the link
        can reshare it with other users by sending additional Zulip messages
        containing the link.

        ## Maximum file size

        The maximum file size for uploads can be configured by the
        administrator of the Zulip server by setting `MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE`
        in the [server's settings][1]. `MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE` defaults
        to 25MB.

            **Note**: This endpoint is limited to organization administrators
            who additionally have the `can_create_users` permission for the Zulip
            organization. Zulip Cloud users can request the `can_create_users`
            permission for a bot by contacting [Zulip Cloud support][support]
            with an explanation for why it is needed. Self-hosted installations
            can toggle `can_create_users` on an account using the `manage.py
            change_user_role` command.

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 4.0 (feature level 36), this endpoint was
        available to all organization administrators.

        This endpoint is most useful for embedding data about a user's
        presence status in other sites (e.g. an employee directory). Full
        Zulip clients like mobile/desktop apps will want to use the [main
        presence endpoint](/api/get-presence), which returns data for all
        active users in the organization, instead.

        See [Zulip's developer documentation][subsystems-presence]
        for details on the data model for presence in Zulip.

                            presence on a particular platform.

                            Generally, the keys for these objects are the names of the different clients
                            where this user is logged in, for example `website` or `ZulipDesktop`.

                            There is also an `aggregated` key, which matches the contents of the object
                            that has been updated most recently.

                            For most applications, you'll just want to look at the

        Change your [status](/help/status-and-availability).

        A request to this endpoint will only change the parameters passed.
        For example, passing just `status_text` requests a change in the status
        text, but will leave the status emoji unchanged.

        Clients that wish to set the user's status to a specific value should
        pass all supported parameters.

        **Changes**: In Zulip 5.0 (feature level 86), added support for
        `emoji_name`, `emoji_code`, and `reaction_type` parameters.
      parameters:
        - name: status_text

            type: string
          allowEmptyValue: true

          description: |
            The text content of the status message. Sending the empty string
            will clear the user's status.

            **Note**: The limit on the size of the message is 60 characters.
          example: on vacation
          required: false
        - name: away
          deprecated: true
          schema:
            type: boolean
          in: query
          description: |
            Whether the user should be marked as "away".

            **Changes**: Deprecated in Zulip 6.0 (feature level 148);
            starting with that feature level, `away` is a legacy way to
            access the user's `presence_enabled` setting, with
            `away = !presence_enabled`. To be removed in a future release.
          example: true
          required: false
        - name: emoji_name

            A string indicating the type of emoji. Each emoji `reaction_type`

            - `unicode_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be a
              dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
              that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

            - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
              the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

            - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Zulip.
              In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.

        This endpoint [mutes a user](/help/mute-a-user). Messages sent by users
        you've muted will be automatically marked as read and hidden.

        Muted users should be implemented by clients as follows:

        - The server will immediately mark all messages sent by the muted
          user as read. This will automatically clear any existing mobile
          push notifications related to the muted user.
        - The server will mark any new messages sent by the muted user as read
          for your account, which prevents all email and mobile push notifications.
        - Clients should exclude muted users from presence lists or other UI
          for viewing or composing 1:1 private messages. 1:1 private messages sent by
          muted users should be hidden everywhere in the Zulip UI.
        - Stream messages and group private messages sent by the muted
          user should avoid displaying the content and name/avatar,
          but should display that N messages by a muted user were
          hidden (so that it is possible to interpret the messages by
          other users who are talking with the muted user).
        - Group private message conversations including the muted user
          should display muted users as "Muted user", rather than
          showing their name, in lists of such conversations, along with using
          a blank grey avatar where avatars are displayed.
        - Administrative/settings UI elements for showing "All users that exist
          on this stream or realm", e.g. for organization
          administration or showing stream subscribers, should display
          the user's name as normal.

      description: |
        This endpoint is used to upload a custom emoji for use in the user's
        organization. Access to this endpoint depends on the
        [organization's configuration](https://zulip.com/help/only-allow-admins-to-add-emoji).
      x-parameter-description: |
        As described above, the image file to upload must be provided in the
        request's body.

        ## Maximum file size

        The maximum file size for uploads can be configured by the
        administrator of the Zulip server by setting `MAX_EMOJI_FILE_SIZE_MIB`
        in the [server's settings][1]. `MAX_EMOJI_FILE_SIZE_MIB` defaults
        to 5MB.

            The name that should be associated with the uploaded emoji image/gif.
            The emoji name can only contain letters, numbers, dashes, and spaces.
            Upper and lower case letters are treated the same, and underscores (\_)
            are treated the same as spaces (consistent with how the Zulip UI
            handles emoji).

        This feature can be invaluable for customizing Zulip's default

        organization is using Zulip. (Note that this only supports
        personal preference settings, like when to send push
        notifications or what emoji set to use, not profile or
        identity settings that naturally should be different for each user).

        settings for existing users in any way.

        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 111), response

                        One of the stream properties described below:

                        - `"color"`: The hex value of the user's display color for the stream.

                        - `"is_muted"`: Whether the stream is [muted](/help/mute-a-stream).<br>
                          **Changes**: As of Zulip 6.0 (feature level 139), updating either
                          `"is_muted"` or `"in_home_view"` generates two [subscription update
                          events](/api/get-events#subscription-update), one for each property,
                          that are sent to clients. Prior to this feature level, updating either
                          property only generated a subscription update event for
                          `"in_home_view"`. <br>
                          **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 2.1.0, this feature was represented
                          by the more confusingly named `"in_home_view"` (with the
                          opposite value: `in_home_view=!is_muted`); for
                          backwards-compatibility, modern Zulip still accepts that property.

                        - `"pin_to_top"`: Whether to pin the stream at the top of the stream list.

                        - `"desktop_notifications"`: Whether to show desktop notifications
                          for all messages sent to the stream.

                        - `"audible_notifications"`: Whether to play a sound
                          notification for all messages sent to the stream.

                        - `"push_notifications"`: Whether to trigger a mobile push
                          notification for all messages sent to the stream.

                        - `"email_notifications"`: Whether to trigger an email
                          notification for all messages sent to the stream.

                        - `"wildcard_mentions_notify"`: Whether wildcard mentions trigger
                          notifications as though they were personal mentions in this stream.

                        representing the hex value of the user's display
                        color for the stream. For all other above properties,

      summary: Register an event queue
      tags: ["real_time_events"]
      description: |
        This powerful endpoint can be used to register a Zulip "event queue"
        (subscribed to certain types of "events", or updates to the messages
        and other Zulip data the current user has access to), as well as to
        fetch the current state of that data.

        (`register` also powers the `call_on_each_event` Python API, and is
        intended primarily for complex applications for which the more convenient
        `call_on_each_event` API is insufficient).

        This endpoint returns a `queue_id` and a `last_event_id`; these can be
        used in subsequent calls to the
        ["events" endpoint](/api/get-events) to request events from
        the Zulip server using long-polling.

        The server will queue events for up to 10 minutes of inactivity.
        After 10 minutes, your event queue will be garbage-collected. The
        server will send `heartbeat` events every minute, which makes it easy
        to implement a robust client that does not miss events unless the
        client loses network connectivity with the Zulip server for 10 minutes
        or longer.

        Once the server garbage-collects your event queue, the server will
        [return an error](/api/get-events#bad_event_queue_id-errors)
        with a code of `BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID` if you try to fetch events from
        the event queue. Your software will need to handle that error
        condition by re-initializing itself (e.g. this is what triggers your
        browser reloading the Zulip web app when your laptop comes back online
        after being offline for more than 10 minutes).

        When prototyping with this API, we recommend first calling `register`
        with no `event_types` parameter to see all the available data from all
        supported event types. Before using your client in production, you
        should set appropriate `event_types` and `fetch_event_types` filters
        so that your client only requests the data it needs. A few minutes
        doing this often saves 90% of the total bandwidth and other resources
        consumed by a client using this API.

        See the
        [events system developer documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/events-system.html)
        if you need deeper details about how the Zulip event queue system
        works, avoids clients needing to worry about large classes of
        potentially messy races, etc.

            if there is a Zulip avatar, and will be `null` for users who
            are using gravatar as their avatar. This option
            significantly reduces the compressed size of user data,
            since gravatar URLs are long, random strings and thus do not
            compress well. The `client_gravatar` field is set to `true` if
            clients can compute their own gravatars.

            The default value is `true` for authenticated requests and

            Dictionary containing details on features the client supports that are
            relevant to the format of responses sent by the server.

            - `notification_settings_null`: Boolean for whether the
              client can handle the current API with null values for
              stream-level notification settings (which means the stream
              is not customized and should inherit the user's global
              notification settings for stream messages).
              <br />
              **Changes**: New in Zulip 2.1.0. In earlier Zulip releases,
              stream-level notification settings were simple booleans.

            - `bulk_message_deletion`: Boolean for whether the client's
              handler for the `delete_message` event type has been
              updated to process the new bulk format (with a
              `message_ids`, rather than a singleton `message_id`).
              Otherwise, the server will send `delete_message` events
              in a loop.
              <br />
              **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 13). This
              capability is for backwards-compatibility; it will be
              required in a future server release.

            - `user_avatar_url_field_optional`: Boolean for whether the
              client required avatar URLs for all users, or supports
              using `GET /avatar/{user_id}` to access user avatars. If the
              client has this capability, the server may skip sending a
              `avatar_url` field in the `realm_user` at its sole discretion
              to optimize network performance. This is an important optimization
              in organizations with 10,000s of users.
              <br />
              **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 18).

            - `stream_typing_notifications`: Boolean for whether the client
              supports stream typing notifications.
              <br />
              **Changes**: New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58). This capability is
              for backwards-compatibility; it will be required in a
              future server release.

            - `user_settings_object`: Boolean for whether the client supports the modern
              `user_settings` event type. If false, the server will additionally send the
              legacy `update_global_notifications` and `update_display_settings` event
              types.
              <br />
              **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 89). This capability is for
              backwards-compatibility; it will be removed in a future server release.
              Because the feature level 89 API changes were merged together, clients can
              safely make a request with this client capability and also request all three
              event types (`user_settings`, `update_display_settings`,
              `update_global_notifications`), and get exactly one copy of settings data on
              any server version. Clients can then use the `zulip_feature_level` in the
              `/register` response or the presence/absence of a `user_settings` key to
              determine where to look for the data.

                          Array of tuples, where each tuple describes a muted topic.
                          The first element of the tuple is the stream name in which the topic
                          has to be muted, the second element is the topic name to be muted
                          and the third element is an integer UNIX timestamp representing
                          when the topic was muted.

                          **Changes**: Deprecated in Zulip 6.0 (feature level 134). Starting

                          array objects were 2-item tuples and did not include the timestamp
                          information for when the topic was muted.

                              available for displaying reactions; the official web
                              application displays names when <=3 total reactions are

                          GIPHY's client-side SDKs needs this API key to use the GIPHY API.
                          GIPHY API keys are not secret (their main purpose appears to be
                          allowing GIPHY to block a problematic app). Please don't use our API
                          key for an app unrelated to Zulip.

                          Developers of clients should also read the

                          The data at the given URL is a JSON object with one property, `code_to_names`.
                          The value of that property is a JSON object where each key is an
                          [emoji code](/api/add-reaction#parameter-emoji_code) for an available
                          Unicode emoji, and each value is the corresponding
                          [emoji names](/api/add-reaction#parameter-emoji_name) for this emoji,
                          with the canonical name for the emoji always appearing first.

                          The HTTP response at that URL will have appropriate HTTP caching headers, such
                          any HTTP implementation should get a cached version if emoji haven't changed
                          since the last request.

                          Recommended client-side HTTP request timeout for [`GET /events`](/api/get-events) calls.
                          This is guaranteed to be somewhat greater than the heartbeat frequency. It is important
                          that clients respect this parameter, so that increases in the heartbeat frequency do not
                          break clients.

        Please note that not all of these attributes are guaranteed to appear in a
        response, for two reasons:

        * This endpoint has evolved over time, so responses from older Zulip servers
          might be missing some keys (in which case a client should assume the
          appropriate default).
        * If a `/server_settings` request is made to the root domain of a
          multi-subdomain server, like the root domain of zulip.com, the settings
          that are realm-specific are not known and thus not provided.

        Fetch global settings for a Zulip server.

        **Note:** this endpoint does not require any authentication at all, and you can use it to check:

        - If this is a Zulip server, and if so, what version of Zulip it's running.
        - What a Zulip client (e.g. a mobile app or
          [zulip-terminal](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal/)) needs to
          know in order to display a login prompt for the server (e.g. what
          authentication methods are available).

        This endpoint is used to edit the current user's settings.

        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this
        endpoint only supported the `full_name`, `email`,
        `old_password`, and `new_password` parameters. Notification
        settings were managed by `PATCH /settings/notifications`, and
        all other settings by `PATCH /settings/display`.

        The feature level 80 migration to merge these endpoints did not
        change how request parameters are encoded. However, it did change
        the handling of any invalid parameters present in a request
        (see feature level 78 change below).

        The `/settings/display` and `/settings/notifications`
        endpoints are now deprecated aliases for this endpoint for
        backwards-compatibility, and will be removed once clients have
        migrated to use this endpoint.

        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 78),
        the `/settings` endpoint indicated which parameters it had
        processed by including in the response object `"key": value`
        entries for values successfully changed by the request. That
        was replaced by the more ergonomic
        `ignored_parameters_unsupported` response parameter.

        The `/settings/notifications` and `/settings/display` endpoints
        also had this behavior before they became aliases of `/settings`
        in Zulip 5.0 (see feature level 80 change above).

        Before these changes, request parameters that were not supported
        (or were unchanged) were silently ignored.

      description: |
        Delete all messages in a topic.

        Topics are a field on messages (not an independent
        data structure), so deleting all the messages in the topic
        deletes the topic from Zulip.

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 6.0 (feature level 147), this
        request did a single atomic operation, which could time out
        for very large topics. It now deletes messages in batches,
        starting with the newest messages, so that progress will be
        made even if the request times out.

        Notify other users whether the current user is typing a message.

        Clients implementing Zulip's typing notifications protocol should work as follows:

        - Send a request to this endpoint with `op = "start"` when a user starts typing a message,
          and also every `TYPING_STARTED_WAIT_PERIOD = 10` seconds that the user continues to
          actively type or otherwise interact with the compose UI (e.g. interacting with the
          compose box emoji picker).
        - Send a request to this endpoint with `op = "stop"` when a user pauses using the
          compose UI for at least `TYPING_STOPPED_WAIT_PERIOD = 5` seconds or cancels
          the compose action (if it had previously sent a "start" operation for that
          compose action).
        - Start displaying "Sender is typing" for a given conversation when the client
          receives an `op = "start"` event from the [`GET /events`](/api/get-events#typing-start)
          endpoint.
        - Continue displaying "Sender is typing" until they receive an `op = "stop"` event
          from the [`GET /events`](/api/get-events#typing-stop) endpoint or
          `TYPING_STARTED_EXPIRY_PERIOD = 15` seconds have passed without a new `op = "start"`
          event for that conversation.
        - Support for displaying stream typing notifications was new in Zulip 4.0
          (feature level 58). Clients should indicate they support processing stream typing
          events via the `stream_typing_notifications` value in the `client_capabilities`
          parameter to [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue#parameter-client_capabilities)
          endpoint.

        This protocol is designed to allow the server-side typing notifications implementation
        to be stateless while being resilient; network failures cannot result in a user being
        incorrectly displayed as perpetually typing.

        See
        [the typing notification docs](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/typing-indicators.html)
        for additional design details on Zulip's typing notifications protocol.

            For `"private"` type it is the user_ids of the recipients of the message being typed.
            Send a JSON-encoded list of user_ids. (Use a list even if there is only one
            recipient.)

            For `"stream"` type it is a single element list containing ID of stream in
            which the message is being typed.

            is new in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58). Previously, typing
            notifications were only for private messages.

            Before Zulip 2.0.0, this parameter accepted only a JSON-encoded
            list of email addresses. Support for the email address-based format was
            removed in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 11).

                                **Changes**: New in Zulip 6.0 (feature level 131).
                                Introduced in feature level 127 as `subgroups`, but
                                clients can ignore older events as this feature level
                                predates subgroups being fully implemented.

        An array of any parameters sent in the request that are not
        supported by the endpoint. While this can be expected, e.g. when sending
        both current and legacy names for a parameter to a Zulip server of
        unknown version, this often indicates either a bug in the client
        implementation or an attempt to configure a new feature while
        connected to an older Zulip server that does not support said feature.

        **Changes**: Added to `POST /users/me/subscriptions/properties` in
        Zulip 5.0 (feature level 111).

        Added to `PATCH /realm/user_settings_defaults` in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 96).

            work correctly. And any client-side security logic for

            policy](/help/message-retention-policy). There are two special values:

            - `null`, the default, means the stream will inherit the organization
              level setting.
            - `-1` encodes retaining messages in this stream forever.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 17).
        history_public_to_subscribers:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            Whether the history of the stream is public to its subscribers.

            Currently always true for public streams (i.e. invite_only=False implies
            history_public_to_subscribers=True), but clients should not make that
            assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.
        first_message_id:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            The id of the first message in the stream.

            Intended to help clients determine whether they need to display
            UI like the "more topics" widget that would suggest the stream
            has older history that can be accessed.

            Null is used for streams with no message history.

          type: boolean
          deprecated: true
          description: |
            Whether the given stream is announcement only or not.

            **Changes**: Deprecated in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1). Clients
            should use `stream_post_policy` instead.
        can_remove_subscribers_group_id:
          type: integer
          description: |
            ID of the user group whose members are allowed to unsubscribe others
            from the stream.

            defining the choices and the order they will be displayed in the
            dropdown UI for individual users to select an option.

            The interface for field type 7 is not yet stabilized.

            (not animated) version of the emoji can be found. (This is
            currently always the first frame of the animation).

            This is useful for clients to display the emoji in contexts
            where continuously animating it would be a bad user experience
            (E.g. because it would be distracting).

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (added as optional field in
            feature level 97 and then made mandatory, but nullable, in

            be used when displaying the stream description in a UI.

            One should use the standard Zulip rendered_markdown CSS when
            displaying this content so that emoji, LaTeX, and other syntax
            work correctly. And any client-side security logic for
            user-generated message content should be applied when displaying

            **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 2.1.0, this feature was
            represented by the more confusingly named `in_home_view` (with the
            opposite value, `in_home_view=!is_muted`).

            Legacy property for if the given stream is muted, with inverted meaning.

            before being automatically deleted by the [message retention
            policy](/help/message-retention-policy). There are two special values:

            - `null`, the default, means the stream will inherit the organization
              level setting.
            - `-1` encodes retaining messages in this stream forever.

          type: boolean
          description: |
            Whether the history of the stream is public to its subscribers.

            Currently always true for public streams (i.e. invite_only=False implies
            history_public_to_subscribers=True), but clients should not make that
            assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.

          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            The id of the first message in the stream.

            Intended to help clients determine whether they need to display
            UI like the "more topics" widget that would suggest the stream
            has older history that can be accessed.

            Null is used for streams with no message history.

            The average number of messages sent to the stream in recent weeks,
            rounded to the nearest integer.

            Null means the stream was recently created and there is

            A string indicating the type of emoji. Each emoji `reaction_type`
            has an independent namespace for values of `emoji_code`.

            Must be one of the following values:

            - `unicode_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be a
              dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
              that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

            - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
              the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

            - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Zulip.
              In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.
              "zulip").

            is the user ID of the bot's owner (usually, whoever created the bot).

            Will be null for legacy bots that do not have an owner.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1). In previous

            query parameter was set to `True` and the user's avatar is hosted by
            the Gravatar provider (i.e. the user has never uploaded an avatar).

            **Changes**: In Zulip 3.0 (feature level 18), if the client has the

  parameters:
    Event_types:
      name: event_types
      in: query
      description: |
        A JSON-encoded array indicating which types of events you're interested
        in. Values that you might find useful include:

        - **message** (messages)
        - **subscription** (changes in your subscriptions)
        - **realm_user** (changes to users in the organization and
          their properties, such as their name).

        If you do not specify this parameter, you will receive all
        events, and have to filter out the events not relevant to
        your client in your client code. For most applications, one
        is only interested in messages, so one specifies:
        `event_types=['message']`

        Event types not supported by the server are ignored, in order to simplify
        the implementation of client apps that support multiple server versions.

          schema:
            type: array
            items:
              type: string
          example: ["message"]
      required: false
    Narrow:
      name: narrow
      in: query
      description: |
        A JSON-encoded array of arrays of length 2 indicating the
        [narrow filter(s)](/api/construct-narrow) for which you'd
        like to receive events for.

        For example, to receive events for private messages (including
        group private messages) received by the user, one can use
        `narrow=[["is", "private"]]`.

        Unlike the API for [fetching messages](/api/get-messages),
        this narrow parameter is simply a filter on messages that the
        user receives through their stream subscriptions (or because
        they are a recipient of a private message).

        This means that a client that requests a `narrow` filter of
        `[["stream", "Denmark"]]` will receive events for new messages
        sent to that stream while the user is subscribed to that
        stream. The client will not receive any message events at all
        if the user is not subscribed to `"Denmark"`.

        Newly created bot users are not usually subscribed to any
        streams, so bots using this API need to be
        [subscribed](/api/subscribe) to any streams whose messages
        you'd like them to process using this endpoint.

        See the `all_public_streams` parameter for how to process all
        public stream messages in an organization.

        Defaults to `[]`.

        enabled, `avatar_url` will be included in the response only
        if there is a Zulip avatar, and will be `null` for users who
        are using gravatar as their avatar. This option
        significantly reduces the compressed size of user data,
        since gravatar URLs are long, random strings and thus do not
        compress well. The `client_gravatar` field is set to `true` if
        clients can compute their own gravatars.

    ReactionType:
      name: reaction_type
      in: query
      description: |
        A string indicating the type of emoji. Each emoji `reaction_type`
        has an independent namespace for values of `emoji_code`.

        If an API client is adding/removing a vote on an existing reaction,
        it should pass this parameter using the value the server provided
        for the existing reaction for specificity. Supported values:

        - `unicode_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be a
          dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
          that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

        - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
          the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

        - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Zulip.
          In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.
          "zulip").

        **Changes**: In Zulip 3.0 (feature level 2), this parameter became
        optional for [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji);
        previously, this endpoint assumed `unicode_emoji` if this
        parameter was not specified.
      schema:
        type: string
      example: "unicode_emoji"
      required: false
    EmojiCode:
      name: emoji_code
      in: query
      description: |
        A unique identifier, defining the specific emoji codepoint requested,
        within the namespace of the `reaction_type`.

        For most API clients, you won't need this, but it's important
        for Zulip apps to handle rare corner cases when
        adding/removing votes on an emoji reaction added previously by
        another user.

        If the existing reaction was added when the Zulip server was
        using a previous version of the emoji data mapping between
        Unicode codepoints and human-readable names, sending the
        `emoji_code` in the data for the original reaction allows the
        Zulip server to correctly interpret your upvote as an upvote
        rather than a reaction with a "different" emoji.

        Number of days that messages sent to this stream will be stored
        before being automatically deleted by the [message retention

        values are supported:

        - "realm_default" => Return to the organization-level setting.
        - "unlimited" => Retain messages forever.

        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 91), retaining
        messages forever was encoded using `"forever"` instead of
        `"unlimited"`.

        New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 17).
