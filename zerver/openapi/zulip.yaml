        This API endpoint is used by clients such as the Zulip mobile and
        terminal apps to implement password-based authentication.  Given the
        user's Zulip login credentials, it returns a Zulip API key that the client
        can use to make requests requests as the user.

        This endpoint is only useful for Zulip servers/organizations with
        EmailAuthBackend or LDAPAuthBackend enabled.

        The Zulip mobile apps also support SSO/social authentication (GitHub
        auth, Google auth, SAML, etc.) that does not use this endpoint.  Instead,
        the mobile apps reuse the web login flow passing the `mobile_flow_otp` in
        a webview, and the credentials are returned to the app (encrypted) via a redirect
        to a `zulip://` URL.

        !!! warn ""
            **Note:** If you signed up using passwordless authentication and
            never had a password, you can [reset your password](/help/change-your-password).

            See the [API keys](/api/api-keys) documentation for
            more details on how to download API key manually.

        For easy testing of mobile apps and other clients and against Zulip
        development servers, we support fetching a Zulip API key for any user
        on the development server without authentication (so that they can
        implement analogues of the one-click login process available for Zulip
        development servers on the web).

        **Note:** This endpoint is only available on Zulip development
        servers; for obvious security reasons it will always return an error
        in a Zulip production server.

                                    One should use the standard Zulip rendered_markdown CSS when
                                    displaying this content so that emoji, LaTeX, and other syntax
                                    work correctly.  And any client-side security logic for
                                    user-generated message content should be applied when displaying
                                    this HTML as though it were the body of a Zulip message.

                                    Whether the history of the stream is public to its subscribers.

                                    Currently always true for public streams (i.e. invite_only=False implies
                                    history_public_to_subscribers=True), but clients should not make that
                                    assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.

        Fetch message history from a Zulip server.

        `GET {{ api_url }}/v1/messages`

        This `GET /api/v1/messages` endpoint is the primary way to fetch
        message history from a Zulip server.  It is useful both for Zulip
        clients (e.g. the web, desktop, mobile, and terminal clients) as well
        as bots, API clients, backup scripts, etc.

        By specifying a [narrow filter](/api/construct-narrow), you can use
        this endpoint to fetch the messages matching any search query that is
        supported by Zulip's powerful full-text search backend.

        When a narrow is not specified, it can be used to fetch a user's
        message history. (We recommend paginating to 1000 messages at a time.)

        In either case, you specify an `anchor` message (or ask the server to
        calculate the first unread message for you and use that as the
        anchor), as well as a number of messages before and after the anchor
        message.  The server returns those messages, sorted by message ID, as
        well as some metadata that makes it easy for a client to determine
        whether there are more messages matching the query that were not
        returned due to the `num_before` and `num_after` limits.

        We recommend using `num_before <= 1000` and `num_after <= 1000` to
        avoid generating very large HTTP responses. A maximum of 5000 messages
        can be obtained per request; attempting to exceed this will result in an
        error.
      parameters:
        - name: anchor
          in: query
          description: |
            Integer message ID to anchor fetching of new messages. Supports special
            string values for when the client wants the server to compute the anchor
            to use:

            * `newest`: The most recent message.
            * `oldest`: The oldest message.
            * `first_unread`: The oldest unread message matching the
              query, if any; otherwise, the most recent message.

            The special values of `'newest'` and `'oldest'` are also supported
            for anchoring the query at the most recent or oldest messages.

            **Changes**: String values are new in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1).  The
              `first_unread` functionality was supported in Zulip 2.1.x
              and older by not sending anchor and using use_first_unread_anchor.

              In Zulip 2.1.x and older, `oldest` can be emulated with
              `anchor=0`, and `newest` with `anchor=10000000000000000`
              (that specific large value works around a bug in Zulip
              2.1.x and older in the `found_newest` return value).

            the [event queue](/api/register-queue)
            ID for the client.  If passed, `local_id` is required.  If the message is
            successfully sent, the server will include `local_id` in the `message` event
            that the client with this `queue_id` will receive notifying it of the new message
            via [`GET /events`](/api/get-events).  This lets the client know unambiguously
            that it should replace the locally echoed message, rather than adding this new
            message (which would be correct if the user had sent the new message from another
            device).

        Check whether a set of messages match a [narrow](/api/construct-narrow).

        `GET {{ api_url }}/v1/messages/matches_narrow`

        For many common narrows (E.g. a topic), clients can write an
        efficient client-side check to determine whether a
        newly arrived message belongs in the view.

        This endpoint is designed to allow clients to handle more complex narrows
        for which the client does not (or in the case of full-text search,
        cannot) implement this check.

        The format of the `match_subject` and `match_content` objects is designed to match
        those of `GET /messages`, so that a client can splice these fields into a
        `message` object received from `GET /events` and end up with an extended message
        object identical to how a `GET /messages` for the current narrow would have
        returned the message.

        Get the presence status for a specific user.

        This endpoint is most useful for embedding data about a user's

        Zulip clients like mobile/desktop apps will want to use the main
        presence endpoint, which returns data for all active users in the
        organization, instead.

                            the names of the different clients where this user is logged in,
                            like `website`, `ZulipDesktop`, `ZulipTerminal`, or
                            `ZulipMobile`. There is also an `aggregated` key, which matches

                            recently. For most applications, you'll just want to look at the

        Subscribe one or more users to one or more streams.

        `POST {{ api_url }}/v1/users/me/subscriptions`

        If any of the specified streams do not exist, they are automatically
        created.  The initial [stream settings](/api/update-stream) will be determined
        by the optional parameters like `invite_only` detailed below.
      parameters:
        - name: subscriptions
          in: query
          description: |
            A list of dictionaries containing the key `name` and value
            specifying the name of the stream to subscribe. If the stream does not
            exist a new stream is created. The description of the stream created can
            be specified by setting the dictionary key `description` with an
            appropriate value.
            The possible values for each `property` and `value` pairs are:

            * `color` (string): the hex value of the user's display color for the stream.
            * `is_muted` (boolean): whether the stream is
              [muted](/help/mute-a-stream).  Prior to Zulip 2.1, this feature was
              represented by the more confusingly named `in_home_view` (with the
              opposite value, `in_home_view=!is_muted`); for
              backwards-compatibility, modern Zulip still accepts that value.
            * `pin_to_top` (boolean): whether to pin the stream at the top of the stream list.
            * `desktop_notifications` (boolean): whether to show desktop notifications
                for all messages sent to the stream.
            * `audible_notifications` (boolean): whether to play a sound
              notification for all messages sent to the stream.
            * `push_notifications` (boolean): whether to trigger a mobile push
                notification for all messages sent to the stream.
            * `email_notifications` (boolean): whether to trigger an email
                notification for all messages sent to the stream.

                                The property to be changed. It is one of:

                                * `color`: The hex value of the user's personal display color for the stream.<br>
                                * `is_muted`: Whether the stream is [muted](/help/mute-a-stream).<br>
                                **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 2.1, this feature was
                                represented by the more confusingly named `in_home_view` (with the
                                opposite value, `in_home_view=!is_muted`); for
                                backwards-compatibility, modern Zulip still accepts that value.<br>
                                * `pin_to_top`: Whether to pin the stream at the top of the stream list.
                                * `desktop_notifications`: Whether to show desktop notifications for all
                                messages sent to the stream.<br>
                                * `audible_notifications`: Whether to play a sound notification for all
                                messages sent to the stream.<br>
                                * `push_notifications`: Whether to trigger a mobile push notification for
                                all messages sent to the stream.<br>
                                * `email_notifications`: Whether to trigger an email notification for all
                                messages sent to the stream.<br>
                                * `in_home_view`: Whether to mute the stream (legacy property)<br>
                                * `wildcard_mentions_notify`: whether wildcard mentions trigger notifications
                                as though they were personal mentions in this stream.<br>
                                A null value means the value of this setting
                                should be inherited from the user-level default
                                setting, wildcard_mentions_notify, for
                                this stream.

            Dictionary containing details on features the client supports that are
            relevant to the format of responses sent by the server.

            * `notification_settings_null`: Boolean for whether the
              client can handle the current API with null values for
              stream-level notification settings (which means the stream
              is not customized and should inherit the user's global
              notification settings for stream messages).  New in Zulip
              2.1.0; in earlier Zulip releases, stream-level
              notification settings were simple booleans.

            * `bulk_message_deletion`: Boolean for whether the client's
               handler for the `delete_message` event type has been
               updated to process the new bulk format (with a
               `message_ids`, rather than a singleton `message_id`).
               Otherwise, the server will send `delete_message` events
               in a loop.  New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 13).  This
               capability is for backwards-compatibility; it will be
               required in a future server release.

            * `user_avatar_url_field_optional`: Boolean for whether the
               client required avatar URLs for all users, or supports
               using `GET /avatar/{user_id}` to access user avatars.  If the
               client has this capability, the server may skip sending a
               `avatar_url` field in the `realm_user` at its sole discretion
               to optimize network performance.  This is an important optimization
               in organizations with 10,000s of users.

                          users with even more unread messages (and not hardcode the number 50000).

        `GET {{ api_url }}/v1/server_settings`

        **Note:** this endpoint does not require any authentication at all, and you can use it to check:

        * If this is a Zulip server, and if so, what version of Zulip it's running.
        * What a Zulip client (e.g. a mobile app or
        [zulip-terminal](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal/)) needs to
        know in order to display a login prompt for the server (e.g. what
        authentication methods are available).

                          available on the server. The feature level increases monotonically;
                          a value of N means the server supports all API features introduced
                          before feature level N.  This is designed to provide a simple way
                          for client apps to decide whether the server supports a given
                          feature or API change.  See the [changelog](/api/changelog) for
                          details on what each feature level means.

                          **Changes**.  New in Zulip 3.0.  We recommend using an implied value
                          of 0 for Zulip servers that do not send this field.

                          for clients to know whether to do client side validation
                          of email address format in a login prompt.

                          This value will be false if the server has [LDAP

        Notify other users whether the current user is typing a message.

        `POST {{ api_url }}/v1/typing`

        Clients implementing Zulip's typing notifications protocol should work as follows:

        * Send a request to this endpoint with `op="start"` when a user starts typing
          a private message or group private message, and also every
          `TYPING_STARTED_WAIT_PERIOD=10` seconds that the user continues to actively type
          or otherwise interact with the compose UI (E.g. interacting with the compose box
          emoji picker).
        * Send a request to this endpoint with `op="stop"` when a user pauses using the
          compose UI for at least `TYPING_STOPPED_WAIT_PERIOD=5` seconds or cancels
          the compose action (if it had previously sent a "start" operation for that
          compose action).
        * Start displaying "Sender is typing" for a given conversation when the client
          receives an `op="start"` event from the [events API](/api/get-events).
        * Continue displaying "Sender is typing" until they receive an `op="stop"` event
          from the [events API](/api/get-events) or `TYPING_STARTED_EXPIRY_PERIOD=15`
          seconds have passed without a new `op="start"` event for that conversation.

        This protocol is designed to allow the server-side typing notifications implementation
        to be stateless while being resilient; network failures cannot result in a user being
        incorrectly displayed as perpetually typing.

        See
        [the typing notification docs](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/typing-indicators.html)
        for additional design details on Zulip's typing notifications protocol.

            list of email addresses.  Support for the email address-based format was
            removed in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 11).

          description: |
            The short description of the stream rendered as HTML, intended to
            be used when displaying the stream description in a UI.

            One should use the standard Zulip rendered_markdown CSS when
            displaying this content so that emoji, LaTeX, and other syntax
            work correctly.  And any client-side security logic for
            user-generated message content should be applied when displaying

            * 3 => Only new members can post.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0, replacing the previous
            `is_announcement_only` boolean.

          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            Number of days that messages sent to this stream will be stored
            before being automatically deleted by the [message retention
            policy](/help/message-retention-policy).  There are two special values:

            * `null`, the default, means the stream will inherit the organization
              level setting.
            * `-1` encodes retaining messages in this stream forever.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 17).
        history_public_to_subscribers:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            Whether the history of the stream is public to its subscribers.

            Currently always true for public streams (i.e. invite_only=False implies
            history_public_to_subscribers=True), but clients should not make that
            assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.
        first_message_id:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            The id of the first message in the stream.

            Intended to help clients determine whether they need to display
            UI like the "more topics" widget that would suggest the stream
            has older history that can be accessed.

            Null is used for streams with no message history.
        is_announcement_only:
          type: boolean
          deprecated: true
          description: |
            Whether the given stream is announcement only or not.

            **Changes**: Deprecated in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1), use
            `stream_post_policy` instead.

            A short description of a stream rendered as HTML, intended to
            be used when displaying the stream description in a UI.

            work correctly.  And any client-side security logic for
            user-generated message content should be applied when displaying

            `All messages` view (previously known as `Home` view).

            **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 2.1, this feature was
            represented by the more confusingly named `in_home_view` (with the
            opposite value, `in_home_view=!is_muted`).

          type: boolean
          deprecated: true
          description: |
            Whether only organization administrators can post to the stream.

          description: |

            before being automatically deleted by the [message retention
            policy](/help/message-retention-policy).  There are two special values:

            * `null`, the default, means the stream will inherit the organization
              level setting.
            * `-1` encodes retaining messages in this stream forever.

          type: boolean
          description: |
            Whether the history of the stream is public to its subscribers.

            Currently always true for public streams (i.e. invite_only=False implies
            history_public_to_subscribers=True), but clients should not make that
            assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.
        first_message_id:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            The id of the first message in the stream.

            Intended to help clients determine whether they need to display
            UI like the "more topics" widget that would suggest the stream
            has older history that can be accessed.

            Null is used for streams with no message history.
        stream_weekly_traffic:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            The average number of messages sent to the stream in recent weeks,
            rounded to the nearest integer.

            ID.  **Deprecated** and to be removed in a future release
            once core clients have migrated to use the `user_id` field.

            the Gravatar provider (i.e. the user has never uploaded an avatar).

            **Changes**: In Zulip 3.0 (feature level 18), if the client has the

            created the bot).

            Will be null for legacy bots that do not have an owner.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level

  parameters:
    Event_types:
      name: event_types
      in: query
      description: |
        A JSON-encoded array indicating which types of events you're interested
        in. Values that you might find useful include:

          * **message** (messages)
          * **subscription** (changes in your subscriptions)
          * **realm_user** (changes to users in the organization and
            their properties, such as their name).

        If you do not specify this parameter, you will receive all
        events, and have to filter out the events not relevant to
        your client in your client code.  For most applications, one
        is only interested in messages, so one specifies:
        `event_types=['message']`

        are using gravatar as their avatar.  This option
        significantly reduces the compressed size of user data,
        since gravatar URLs are long, random strings and thus do not
        compress well. The `client_gravatar` field is set to `true` if

    ReactionType:

        If an app is adding/removing a vote on an existing reaction,
        it should pass this parameter using the value the server provided
        for the existing reaction for specificity.  Supported values:

        * `unicode_emoji`: Unicode emoji (`emoji_code` will be its Unicode codepoint).
        * `realm_emoji`: Custom emoji. (`emoji_code` will be its ID).
        * `zulip_extra_emoji`: Special emoji included with Zulip.  Exists to
           namespace the `zulip` emoji.

        **Changes**: In Zulip 3.0 (feature level 2), this become
        optional for [custom emoji](/help/add-custom-emoji);
        previously, this endpoint assumed `unicode_emoji` if this
        parameter was not specified.

      in: query
      description: |
        A unique identifier, defining the specific emoji codepoint requested,
        within the namespace of the `reaction_type`.

        For most API clients, you won't need this, but it's important
        for Zulip apps to handle rare corner cases when
        adding/removing votes on an emoji reaction added previously by
        another user.

        If the existing reaction was added when the Zulip server was
        using a previous version of the emoji data mapping between
        Unicode codepoints and human-readable names, sending the
        `emoji_code` in the data for the original reaction allows the
        Zulip server to correctly interpret your upvote as an upvote
        rather than a reaction with a "diffenent" emoji.
