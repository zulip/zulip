      summary: Fetch an API key (production)
      tags: ["authentication"]
      description: |
        This API endpoint is used by clients such as the Zulip mobile and
        terminal apps to implement password-based authentication. Given the
        user's Zulip login credentials, it returns a Zulip API key that the client
        can use to make requests as the user.

        This endpoint is only useful for Zulip servers/organizations with
        EmailAuthBackend or LDAPAuthBackend enabled.

        The Zulip mobile apps also support SSO/social authentication (GitHub
        auth, Google auth, SAML, etc.) that does not use this endpoint. Instead,
        the mobile apps reuse the web login flow passing the `mobile_flow_otp` in
        a webview, and the credentials are returned to the app (encrypted) via a redirect
        to a `zulip://` URL.

        !!! warn ""

            **Note:** If you signed up using passwordless authentication and
            never had a password, you can [reset your password](/help/change-your-password).

        See the [API keys](/api/api-keys) documentation for more details
        on how to download an API key manually.

        In a [Zulip development environment](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/overview.html),
        see also [the unauthenticated variant](/api/dev-fetch-api-key).

      description: |
        For easy testing of mobile apps and other clients and against Zulip
        development servers, we support fetching a Zulip API key for any user
        on the development server without authentication (so that they can
        implement analogues of the one-click login process available for Zulip
        development servers on the web).

            **Note:** This endpoint is only available on Zulip development
            servers; for obvious security reasons it will always return an error
            in a Zulip production server.

      description: |
        This endpoint allows you to receive new events from
        [a registered event queue](/api/register-queue).

        Long-lived clients should use the
        `event_queue_longpoll_timeout_seconds` property returned by
        `POST /register` as the client-side HTTP request timeout for
        calls to this endpoint. It is guaranteed to be higher than
        heartbeat frequency and should be respected by clients to
        avoid breaking when heartbeat frequency increases.

            [the `POST /register` endpoint](/api/register-queue) to this
            endpoint and a queue would be registered in the absence of a `queue_id`.

                                **Changes**: The `update_display_settings` and `update_global_notifications`
                                legacy event types that had been deprecated in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 89)
                                were removed entirely in Zulip 12.0 (feature level 439). All clients should
                                be using the `user_settings` event type to access user settings.

                                New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 89), replacing the
                                previous `update_display_settings` and `update_global_notifications`
                                event types, which are still present for backwards compatibility reasons.

                                        When a user is deactivated or reactivated. Only
                                        users who can access the modified user under the
                                        organization's `can_access_all_users_group` policy
                                        will receive this event.

                                        Clients receiving a deactivation event should
                                        remove the user from all user groups in their data
                                        structures, because deactivated users cannot be
                                        members of groups.

                                        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 10.0 (feature level
                                        303), reactivation events were sent to users who
                                        could not access the reactivated user due to a
                                        `can_access_all_users_group` policy. Also,
                                        previously, Clients were not required to update
                                        group membership records during user deactivation.

                                        New in Zulip 8.0 (feature level 222). Previously the server
                                        sent a `realm_user` event with `op` field set to `remove`
                                        when deactivating a user and a `realm_user` event with `op`
                                        field set to `add` when reactivating a user.

                                See the [`stream op: update` event](/api/get-events#stream-update)
                                for updates to global properties of a channel.

                                    Clients should generally handle an unknown property received here without
                                    crashing, since that will naturally happen when connecting to a Zulip
                                    server running a new version that adds a new subscription property.

                                    **Changes**: As of Zulip 6.0 (feature level 139), updates to the `is_muted`
                                    property or the deprecated `in_home_view` property will send two `subscription`
                                    update events, one for each property, to support clients fully migrating to
                                    use the `is_muted` property. Prior to this feature level, updates to either
                                    property only sent one event with the deprecated `in_home_view` property.

                                Event sent when another user subscribes to a channel, or their
                                subscription is newly visible to the current user.

                                When a user subscribes to a channel, the current user will receive this
                                event only if they [have permission to see the channel's subscriber
                                list](/help/channel-permissions). When the current user gains permission
                                to see a given channel's subscriber list, they will receive this event
                                for the existing subscriptions to the channel.

                                **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 8.0 (feature level 220), this event was
                                incorrectly not sent to guest users when subscribers to web-public
                                channels and subscribed public channels changed.

                                Prior to Zulip 8.0 (feature level 205), this event was not sent when
                                a user gained access to a channel due to their [role
                                changing](/help/user-roles).

                                Prior to Zulip 6.0 (feature level 134), this event was not sent when a
                                private channel was made public.

                                In Zulip 4.0 (feature level 35), the singular `user_id` and `stream_id`
                                integers included in this event were replaced with plural `user_ids` and
                                `stream_ids` integer arrays.

                                In Zulip 3.0 (feature level 19), the `stream_id` field was added to
                                identify the channel the user subscribed to, replacing the `name` field.

                                    The user's [message flags][message-flags] for the message.

                                    Clients should inspect the flags field rather than assuming that
                                    new messages are unread; [muted users](/api/mute-user), messages
                                    sent by the current user, and more subtle scenarios can result
                                    in a new message that the server has already marked as read for
                                    the user.

                                    **Changes**: In Zulip 8.0 (feature level 224), the `wildcard_mentioned`
                                    flag was deprecated in favor of the `stream_wildcard_mentioned` and
                                    `topic_wildcard_mentioned` flags. The `wildcard_mentioned` flag exists
                                    for backwards compatibility with older clients and equals
                                    `stream_wildcard_mentioned || topic_wildcard_mentioned`. Clients
                                    supporting older server versions should treat this field as a previous
                                    name for the `stream_wildcard_mentioned` flag as topic wildcard mentions
                                    were not available prior to this feature level.

                                A simple event sent when the set of invitations changes.
                                This event is sent to organization administrators and the creator of
                                the changed invitation; this tells clients they need to refetch
                                data from `GET /invites` if they are displaying UI containing active
                                invitations.

                                **Changes**: Before Zulip 8.0 (feature level 209), this event was
                                only sent to organization administrators.

                                Event sent to all users in a Zulip organization when a new
                                user joins or when a guest user gains access to a user.
                                Processing this event is important to being able to display
                                basic details on other users given only their ID.

                                If the current user is a guest whose access to a newly created user
                                is limited by a `can_access_all_users_group` policy, and the event
                                queue was registered with the `user_list_incomplete` client
                                capability, then the event queue will not receive an event for such
                                a new user. If a newly created user is inaccessible to the current
                                user via such a policy, but the client lacks `user_list_incomplete`
                                client capability, then this event will be delivered to the queue,
                                with an "Unknown user" object with the usual format but placeholder
                                data whose only variable content is the user ID.

                                **Changes**: Before Zulip 8.0 (feature level 232), the
                                `user_list_incomplete` client capability did not exist, and so all
                                clients whose access to a new user was prevented by
                                `can_access_all_users_group` policy would receive a fake "Unknown
                                user" event for such a user.

                                Starting with Zulip 8.0 (feature level 228),
                                this event is also sent when a guest user gains access to
                                a user.

                                Event sent to all users in an organization when a user comes back
                                online after being offline for a while.

                                In addition to handling these events, a client that wants to
                                maintain presence data must poll the [main presence
                                endpoint](https://zulip.com/api/get-presence). Most updates to
                                presence data, refreshing the timestamps of users who are already
                                online, do not appear in the event queue. This design is an
                                optimization by allowing those updates to be batched up, because
                                there is no urgency in the information that an already-online user
                                is still online.

                                These events are provided because when a user transitions from
                                offline to online, that is information the client may want to show
                                promptly in the UI to avoid showing a confusing state (for example,
                                if the newly-online user sends a message or otherwise demonstrates
                                they're online).

                                If the client supports the `simplified_presence_events` [client
                                capability](/api/register-queue#parameter-client_capabilities),
                                these events will include the `presences` field, which provides the
                                modified user's presence data in the modern format. Clients are
                                strongly encouraged to implement this client capability, as legacy
                                format support will be removed in a future release.

                                If the `CAN_ACCESS_ALL_USERS_GROUP_LIMITS_PRESENCE` server-level
                                setting is set to `true`, then the event is only sent to users
                                who can access the user who came back online.

                                **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 11.0 (feature level 419), the
                                `simplified_presence_events` client capability did not exist.
                                Therefore, all events were in the legacy format, and did not
                                include the `presences` field.

                                Prior to Zulip 8.0 (feature level 228), this event was sent to all
                                users in the organization.

                                Event sent when a user loses access to a channel they previously
                                [could access](/help/channel-permissions) because they are
                                unsubscribed from a private channel or their [role](/help/user-roles)

                                This event is also sent when a channel is archived but only
                                to clients that did not declare the `archived_channels` [client

                                was archived.

                                Prior to Zulip 8.0 (feature level 205), this event was not sent
                                when a user lost access to a channel due to their role changing.

                                sent when the `first_message_id` property of a channel was
                                updated because the oldest message that had been sent to it
                                changed.

                                    Note: Only present if the changed property was `description`.

                                    The short description of the channel rendered as HTML, intended to
                                    be used when displaying the channel description in a UI.

                                    One should use the standard Zulip rendered_markdown CSS when
                                    displaying this content so that emoji, LaTeX, and other syntax
                                    work correctly. And any client-side security logic for
                                    user-generated message content should be applied when displaying
                                    this HTML as though it were the body of a Zulip message.

                                    See [Markdown message formatting](/api/message-formatting) for details on Zulip's HTML format.

                                    Whether the history of the channel is public to its subscribers.

                                    Currently always true for public channels (i.e. `"invite_only": false` implies
                                    `"history_public_to_subscribers": true`), but clients should not make that
                                    assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.

                                    Whether the channel's history is now readable by web-public spectators.

                                Event sent when a message has been deleted.

                                Sent to all users who currently are subscribed to the
                                messages' recipient. May also be sent to additional users
                                who had access to it, including, in particular, an
                                administrator user deleting messages in a stream that they
                                are not subscribed to.

                                This means that clients can assume that they will always
                                receive an event of this type for deletions that the
                                client itself initiated.

                                This event is also sent when the user loses access to a message,
                                such as when it is [moved to a channel][message-move-channel] that
                                the user does not [have permission to access][channel-access].

                                **Changes**: Before Zulip 9.0 (feature level 274), this
                                event was only sent to subscribers of the message's recipient.

                                Before Zulip 5.0 (feature level 77), events
                                for direct messages contained additional `sender_id` and
                                `recipient_id` fields.

                                    Before Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1), the `muted_topics`
                                    array objects were 2-item tuples and did not include the timestamp
                                    information for when the topic was muted.

                                      longer has a special visibility policy for this topic.
                                    - 1 = Muted. Used to record [muted topics](/help/mute-a-topic).

                                    In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 170), added unmuted as a visibility

                                    **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 114), this field was
                                    omitted for [inline URL preview][inline-url-previews] updates.

                                    This field should be used by clients to determine if the event
                                    only provides a rendering update to the message content,
                                    such as for an [inline URL preview][inline-url-previews].
                                    When `true`, the event does not reflect a user-generated edit
                                    and does not modify the message history.

                                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 114). Clients can
                                    correctly identify these rendering update events prior to this
                                    feature level by checking whether the `user_id` field was omitted.

                                    The ID of the message which was edited or updated.

                                    This field should be used to apply content edits to the client's
                                    cached message history, or to apply rendered content updates.

                                    If the channel or topic was changed, the set of moved messages is
                                    encoded in the separate `message_ids` field, which is guaranteed
                                    to include `message_id`.
                                message_ids:
                                  type: array

                                    A sorted list of IDs of messages to which any channel or topic
                                    changes encoded in this event should be applied.

                                    This list always includes `message_id`, even when there are no
                                    channel or topic changes to apply.

                                    These messages are guaranteed to have all been previously sent
                                    to channel `stream_id` with topic `orig_subject`, and have been
                                    moved to `new_stream_id` with topic `subject` (if those fields
                                    are present in the event).

                                    Clients processing these events should update all cached message
                                    history associated with the moved messages (including adjusting
                                    `unread_msgs` data structures, where the client may not have the
                                    message itself in its history) to reflect the new channel and
                                    topic.

                                    Content changes should be applied only to the single message
                                    indicated by `message_id`.

                                    **Changes**: Before Zulip 11.0 (feature level 393), this list
                                    was not guaranteed to be sorted.
                                flags:
                                  type: array
                                  description: |
                                    The user's personal [message flags][message-flags] for the
                                    message with ID `message_id` following the edit.

                                    A client application should compare these to the original flags
                                    to identify cases where a mention or alert word was added by the
                                    edit.

                                    **Changes**: In Zulip 8.0 (feature level 224), the `wildcard_mentioned`
                                    flag was deprecated in favor of the `stream_wildcard_mentioned` and
                                    `topic_wildcard_mentioned` flags. The `wildcard_mentioned` flag exists
                                    for backwards compatibility with older clients and equals
                                    `stream_wildcard_mentioned || topic_wildcard_mentioned`. Clients
                                    supporting older server versions should treat this field as a previous
                                    name for the `stream_wildcard_mentioned` flag as topic wildcard mentions
                                    were not available prior to this feature level.

                                    [message-flags]: /api/update-message-flags#available-flags

                                    The UNIX timestamp when this message edit operation was processed by
                                    the server, in UTC seconds.

                                    **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 114), this field
                                    was omitted for [inline URL preview][inline-url-previews] updates.
                                stream_name:
                                  type: string

                                    Only present if the message was edited and originally sent to a channel.

                                    The name of the channel that the message was sent to. Clients
                                    are recommended to use the `stream_id` field instead.
                                stream_id:
                                  type: integer

                                    Only present if the message was edited and originally sent to a channel.

                                    The pre-edit channel for all of the messages with IDs in
                                    `message_ids`.

                                    **Changes**: As of Zulip 5.0 (feature level 112), this field
                                    is present for all edits to a channel message. Previously, it
                                    was not present when only the content of the channel message was
                                    edited.
                                new_stream_id:

                                    Only present if message(s) were moved to a different channel.

                                    The post-edit channel for all of the messages with IDs in
                                    `message_ids`.
                                propagate_mode:
                                  type: string
                                  description: |
                                    Only present if this event moved messages to a different
                                    topic and/or channel.

                                    The choice the editing user made about which messages should be
                                    affected by a channel/topic edit:

                                    - `"change_one"`: Just change the one indicated in `message_id`.
                                    - `"change_later"`: Change messages in the same topic that had
                                      been sent after this one.
                                    - `"change_all"`: Change all messages in that topic.

                                    This parameter should be used to decide whether to change
                                    navigation and compose box state in response to the edit. For
                                    example, if the user was previously in topic narrow, and the
                                    topic was edited with `"change_later"` or `"change_all"`, the Zulip
                                    web app will automatically navigate to the new topic narrow.
                                    Similarly, a message being composed to the old topic should
                                    have its recipient changed to the new topic.

                                    This navigation makes it much more convenient to move content
                                    between topics without disruption or messages continuing
                                    to be sent to the pre-edit topic by accident.

                                    - change_one

                                    if the actual pre-edit topic name is empty string, this field's value will instead

                                    client capability didn't exist and empty string as the topic name for

                                Event sent to a user when [message flags][message-flags] are added
                                to messages.

                                This can reflect a direct user action, or can be the indirect
                                consequence of another action. Whatever the cause, if there's a change
                                in the set of message flags that the user has for a message, then an
                                `update_message_flags` event will be sent with the change. Note
                                that this applies when the user already had access to the message, and
                                continues to have access to it. When a message newly appears or
                                disappears, a [`message`][message-event] or
                                [`delete_message`][message-delete] event is sent instead.

                                Some examples of actions that trigger an `update_message_flags`
                                event:

                                - The `"starred"` flag is added when the user chooses to [star a
                                  message](/help/star-a-message).
                                - The `"read"` flag is added when the user marks messages as read by
                                  scrolling through them, or uses [Mark all messages as read][all-read]
                                  on a conversation.
                                - The `"read"` flag is added when the user [mutes](/help/mute-a-user) a
                                  message's sender.
                                - The `"read"` flag is added after the user unsubscribes from a channel,
                                  or messages are moved to a not-subscribed channel, provided the user
                                  can still access the messages at all. Note a
                                  [`delete_message`][message-delete] event is sent in the case where the
                                  user can no longer access the messages.

                                In some cases, a change in message flags that's caused by another change
                                may happen a short while after the original change, rather than
                                simultaneously. For example, when messages that were unread are moved to
                                a channel where the user is not subscribed, the resulting change in
                                message flags (and the corresponding `update_message_flags` event with
                                flag `"read"`) may happen later than the message move itself. The delay
                                in that example is typically at most a few hundred milliseconds and can
                                in rare cases be minutes or longer.

                                when a property of a user group is changed.

                                For group deactivation, this event is only sent
                                if `include_deactivated_groups` client capability

                                event can also be sent when deactivating or reactivating a user.

                                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 6.0 (feature level 131).
                                    Previously, this was called `subgroup_ids`, but
                                    clients can ignore older events as this feature level
                                    predates subgroups being fully implemented.
                              example:
                                {

                                Event sent to all users in a Zulip organization when the
                                set of configured [linkifiers](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier)
                                for the organization has changed.

                                Processing this event is important for doing Markdown local echo
                                correctly.

                                Clients will not receive this event unless the event queue is
                                registered with the client capability
                                `{"linkifier_url_template": true}`.
                                See [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue#parameter-client_capabilities)
                                for how client capabilities can be specified.

                                **Changes**: Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 176), the
                                `linkifier_url_template` client capability was not required. The
                                requirement was added because linkifiers were updated to contain
                                a URL template instead of a URL format string, which was not a
                                backwards-compatible change.

                                New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 54), replacing the deprecated
                                `realm_filters` event type.

                                    An array of tuples, where each tuple described a linkifier. The first
                                    element of the tuple was a string regex pattern which represented the
                                    pattern to be linkified on matching, for example `"#(?P<id>[123])"`.
                                    The second element was the URL format string that the pattern should be
                                    linkified with. A URL format string for the above example would be
                                    `"https://realm.com/my_realm_filter/%(id)s"`. And the third element

                                The simpler of two possible event types sent to all users
                                in a Zulip organization when the configuration of the
                                organization (realm) has changed.

                                Often individual settings are migrated from this format to
                                the [realm/update_dict](#realm-update_dict) event format when additional realm
                                settings are added whose values are coupled to each other
                                in some way. The specific values supported by this event
                                type are documented in the [realm/update_dict](#realm-update_dict)
                                documentation.

                                A correct client implementation should convert these
                                events into the corresponding [realm/update_dict](#realm-update_dict)
                                event and then process that.

                                **Changes**: Removed `extra_data` optional property in Zulip 10.0
                                (feature level 306). The `extra_data` used to include an
                                `upload_quota` field when changed property was `plan_type`. The
                                server now sends a standard `realm/update_dict` event for plan
                                changes.

                                Event sent to all users in a Zulip organization when the
                                organization (realm) is deactivated. Its main purpose is to
                                flush active longpolling connections so clients can immediately
                                show the organization as deactivated.

                                Clients cannot rely on receiving this event, because they will
                                no longer be able to authenticate to the Zulip API due to the
                                deactivation, and thus can miss it if they did not have an active
                                longpolling connection at the moment of deactivation.

                                Correct handling of realm deactivations requires that clients
                                parse authentication errors from GET /events; if that is done
                                correctly, the client can ignore this event type and rely on its
                                handling of the `GET /events` request it will do immediately
                                after processing this batch of events.

                                Event sent to all the users whenever the Zulip server restarts.

                                Specifically, this event is sent whenever the Tornado process
                                for the user is restarted; in particular, this will always happen
                                when the Zulip server is upgraded.

                                Clients should use this event to update their tracking of the
                                server's capabilities, and to decide if they wish to get a new
                                event queue after a server upgrade. Clients doing so must
                                implement a random delay strategy to spread such restarts over 5
                                minutes or more to avoid creating a synchronized thundering herd
                                effect.

                                **Changes**: Removed the `immediate` flag, which was only used by
                                web clients in development, in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 240).

                                An event which signals the official Zulip web/desktop app to update,
                                by reloading the page and fetching a new queue; this will generally
                                follow a `restart` event. Clients which do not obtain their code
                                from the server (e.g. mobile and terminal clients, which store their
                                code locally) should ignore this event.

                                Clients choosing to reload the application must implement a random
                                delay strategy to spread such restarts over 5 or more minutes to
                                avoid creating a synchronized thundering herd effect.

                                The more general of two event types that may be used when
                                sending an event to all users in a Zulip organization when
                                the configuration of the organization (realm) has changed.

                                Unlike the simpler [realm/update](#realm-update) event format, this
                                event type supports multiple properties being changed in a
                                single event.

                                This event is also sent when deactivating or reactivating a user
                                for settings set to anonymous user groups which the user is direct
                                member of. When deactivating the user, event is only sent to users
                                who cannot access the deactivated user.

                                **Changes**: Starting with Zulip 10.0 (feature level 303), this
                                event can also be sent when deactivating or reactivating a user.

                                In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 163), the realm setting
                                `email_address_visibility` was removed. It was replaced by a [user
                                setting](/api/update-settings#parameter-email_address_visibility) with
                                a [realm user default][user-defaults], with the encoding of different
                                values preserved. Clients can support all versions by supporting the
                                current API and treating every user as having the realm's
                                `email_address_visibility` value.

                                    **Changes**: In Zulip 10.0 (feature level 316), `edit_topic_policy`
                                    property was removed and replaced by `can_move_messages_between_topics_group`
                                    realm setting.

                                    In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 183), the
                                    `community_topic_editing_limit_seconds` property was removed.
                                    It was documented as potentially returned as a changed property
                                    in this event, but in fact it was only ever returned in the
                                    [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) response.

                                    Before Zulip 6.0 (feature level 150), on changing any of
                                    `allow_message_editing`, `message_content_edit_limit_seconds`, or
                                    `edit_topic_policy` settings, this object included all the three settings
                                    irrespective of which of these settings were changed. Now, a separate event
                                    is sent for each changed setting.
                                  properties:
                                    allow_message_editing:

                                        methods are enabled for the organization. For authentication UI itself,
                                        clients should use the pre-authentication metadata returned by

                                        mobile push notifications APIs. The new API uses end-to-end
                                        encryption to protect message content and metadata from
                                        being accessible to the push bouncer service, APNs, and
                                        FCM. Clients that support the new E2EE API will use it
                                        automatically regardless of this setting.

                                        If `true`, mobile push notifications sent to clients that
                                        lack support for E2EE push notifications will always have
                                        "New message" as their content. Note that these legacy
                                        mobile notifications will still contain metadata, which may
                                        include the message's ID, the sender's name, email address,
                                        and avatar.

                                        In a future release, once the official mobile apps have
                                        implemented fully validated their E2EE protocol support,
                                        this setting will become strict, and disable the legacy
                                        protocol entirely.

                                        **Changes**: In Zulip 10.0 (feature level 353), added the Zoom Server
                                        to Server OAuth option.

                                        In Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1), added the None option
                                        to disable video call UI.

                      #### BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID errors

                      This error occurs if the target event queue has been garbage collected.
                      A compliant client will handle this error by re-initializing itself
                      (e.g. a Zulip web app browser window will reload in this case).

                      See [the /register endpoint docs](/api/register-queue) for details on how to
                      handle these correctly.

      tags: ["messages"]
      description: |
        Marks all of the current user's unread messages as read.

        Because this endpoint marks messages as read in batches, it is possible
        for the request to time out after only marking some messages as read.
        When this happens, the `complete` boolean field in the success response
        will be `false`. Clients should repeat the request when handling such a
        response. If all messages were marked as read, then the success response
        will return `"complete": true`.

        **Changes**: Deprecated; clients should use the [update personal message
        flags for narrow](/api/update-message-flags-for-narrow) endpoint instead
        as this endpoint will be removed in a future release.

        Before Zulip 8.0 (feature level 211), if the server's
        processing was interrupted by a timeout, but some messages were marked
        as read, then it would return `"result": "partially_completed"`, along
        with a `code` field for an error string, in the success response to
        indicate that there was a timeout and that the client should repeat the
        request.

        Before Zulip 6.0 (feature level 153), this request did a single atomic
        operation, which could time out with 10,000s of unread messages to mark
        as read. As of this feature level, messages are marked as read in
        batches, starting with the newest messages, so that progress is made
        even if the request times out. And, instead of returning an error when
        the request times out and some messages have been marked as read, a
        success response with `"result": "partially_completed"` is returned.

                    Note that, while `"private"` is supported for scheduling direct

                    (`"type": "stream"` or `"type": "channel"`), ignored otherwise.

                    Clients should use the `max_topic_length` returned by the
                    [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) endpoint to determine
                    the maximum topic length.

                    Note: When `"(no topic)"` or the value of `realm_empty_topic_display_name`
                    found in the [POST /register](/api/register-queue) response is used for this
                    parameter, it is interpreted as an empty string.

                    When [topics are required](/help/require-topics), this parameter can't
                    be `"(no topic)"`, an empty string, or the value of `realm_empty_topic_display_name`.

                    **Changes**: Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 370), `"(no topic)"`
                    was not interpreted as an empty string.

                    Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 334), empty string
                    was not a valid topic name for channel messages.

                    When updating the type of the scheduled message, the `to` parameter
                    is required. And, if updating the type of the scheduled message to
                    `"stream"`/`"channel"`, then the `topic` parameter is also required.

                    Note that, while `"private"` is supported for scheduling direct
                    messages, clients are encouraged to use to the modern convention of
                    `"direct"` to indicate this message type, because support for
                    `"private"` may eventually be removed.

        This endpoint is the primary way to fetch a messages. It is used by all official
        Zulip clients (e.g. the web, desktop, mobile, and terminal clients) as well as
        many bots, API clients, backup scripts, etc.

        Most queries will specify a [narrow filter](/api/get-messages#parameter-narrow),
        to fetch the messages matching any supported [search
        query](/help/search-for-messages). If not specified, it will return messages
        corresponding to the user's [combined feed](/help/combined-feed). There are two
        ways to specify which messages matching the narrow filter to fetch:

        - A range of messages, described by an `anchor` message ID (or a string-format
          specification of how the server should computer an anchor to use) and a maximum
          number of messages in each direction from that anchor.

        - A rarely used variant (`message_ids`) where the client specifies the message IDs
          to fetch.

        The server returns the matching messages, sorted by message ID, as well as some
        metadata that makes it easy for a client to determine whether there are more
        messages matching the query that were not returned due to the `num_before` and
        `num_after` limits.

        Note that a user's message history does not contain messages sent to
        channels before they [subscribe](/api/subscribe), and newly created
        bot users are not usually subscribed to any channels.

        We recommend requesting at most 1000 messages in a batch, to avoid generating very
        large HTTP responses. A maximum of 5000 messages can be obtained per request;
        attempting to exceed this will result in an error.

        **Changes**: The `message_ids` option is new in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 300).

            Integer message ID to anchor fetching of new messages. Supports special
            string values for when the client wants the server to compute the anchor
            to use:

            - `newest`: The most recent message.
            - `oldest`: The oldest message.
            - `first_unread`: The oldest unread message matching the
              query, if any; otherwise, the most recent message.

            **Changes**: String values are new in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1). The
            `first_unread` functionality was supported in Zulip 2.1.x
            and older by not sending `anchor` and using `use_first_unread_anchor`.

            In Zulip 2.1.x and older, `oldest` can be emulated with
            `"anchor": 0`, and `newest` with `"anchor": 10000000000000000`
            (that specific large value works around a bug in Zulip
            2.1.x and older in the `found_newest` return value).

            The narrow where you want to fetch the messages from. See how to
            [construct a narrow](/api/construct-narrow).

            Note that many narrows, including all that lack a `channel`, `channels`,
            `stream`, or `streams` operator, search the user's personal message
            history. See [searching shared
            history](/help/search-for-messages#search-shared-history)
            for details.

            For example, if you would like to fetch messages from all public channels instead
            of only the user's message history, then a specific narrow for
            messages sent to all public channels can be used:
            `{"operator": "channels", "operand": "public"}`.

            Newly created bot users are not usually subscribed to any
            channels, so bots using this API should either be
            subscribed to appropriate channels or use a shared history
            search narrow with this endpoint.

            **Changes**: See [changes section](/api/construct-narrow#changes)
            of search/narrow filter documentation.

                                    for backwards compatibility with older clients and equals
                                    `stream_wildcard_mentioned || topic_wildcard_mentioned`. Clients
                                    supporting older server versions should treat this field as a previous
                                    name for the `stream_wildcard_mentioned` flag as topic wildcard mentions
                                    were not available prior to this feature level.

                    `"direct"` for a direct message and `"stream"` or `"channel"` for a
                    channel message.

                    **Changes**: In Zulip 9.0 (feature level 248), `"channel"` was added as
                    an additional value for this parameter to request a channel message.

                    In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 174), `"direct"` was added as
                    the preferred way to request a direct message, deprecating the original
                    `"private"`. While `"private"` is still supported for requesting direct
                    messages, clients are encouraged to use to the modern convention with
                    servers that support it, because support for `"private"` will eventually
                    be removed.

                    The topic of the message. Only required for channel messages
                    (`"type": "stream"` or `"type": "channel"`), ignored otherwise.

                    Clients should use the `max_topic_length` returned by the
                    [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) endpoint to determine
                    the maximum topic length.

                    Note: When `"(no topic)"` or the value of `realm_empty_topic_display_name`
                    found in the [POST /register](/api/register-queue) response is used for this
                    parameter, it is interpreted as an empty string.

                    When [topics are required](/help/require-topics), this parameter can't
                    be `"(no topic)"`, an empty string, or the value of `realm_empty_topic_display_name`.

                    **Changes**: Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 370), `"(no topic)"`
                    was not interpreted as an empty string.

                    Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 334), empty string
                    was not a valid topic name for channel messages.

                    New in Zulip 2.0.0. Previous Zulip releases encoded
                    this as `subject`, which is currently a deprecated alias.

                    For clients supporting
                    [local echo](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/sending-messages.html#local-echo),
                    the [event queue](/api/register-queue)
                    ID for the client. If passed, `local_id` is required. If the message is
                    successfully sent, the server will include `local_id` in the `message` event
                    that the client with this `queue_id` will receive notifying it of the new message
                    via [`GET /events`](/api/get-events). This lets the client know unambiguously
                    that it should replace the locally echoed message, rather than adding this new
                    message (which would be correct if the user had sent the new message from another
                    device).

                    inspecting it, as described in the `queue_id` description.

                          If the message's sender had configured their [visibility policy settings](/help/mute-a-topic)
                          to potentially automatically follow or unmute topics when sending messages,
                          and one of these policies did in fact change the user's visibility policy
                          for the topic where this message was sent, the new value for that user's
                          visibility policy for the recipient topic.

                          Only present if the sender's visibility was in fact changed.

                          The value can be either [unmuted or followed](/api/update-user-topic#parameter-visibility_policy).

                          Clients will also be notified about the change in policy via a
                          `user_topic` event as usual. This field is intended to be used by clients
                          to explicitly inform the user when a topic's visibility policy was changed

                          For example, the Zulip web application uses this field to decide whether
                          to display a warning or notice suggesting to unmute the topic after
                          sending a message to a muted channel. Such a notice would be confusing in
                          the event that the act of sending the message had already resulted in the
                          user automatically unmuting or following the topic in question.

                            <b>Changes</b>: Deprecated in Zulip 8.0 (feature level 224), in favor of
                            the <code>stream_wildcard_mentioned</code> and
                            <code>topic_wildcard_mentioned</code> flags. The
                            <code>wildcard_mentioned</code> flag exists for backwards compatibility
                            with older clients and equals
                            <code>stream_wildcard_mentioned || topic_wildcard_mentioned</code>.
                            Clients supporting older server versions should treat this field as a
                            previous name for the <code>stream_wildcard_mentioned</code> flag as
                            topic wildcard mentions were not available prior to this feature level.

                          Zulip has an invariant that all unread messages must be in channels
                          the user is subscribed to. This field will contain a list of the
                          channels whose messages were skipped to mark as unread because the
                          user is not subscribed to them.

                    The narrow you want update flags within. See how to
                    [construct a narrow](/api/construct-narrow).

                    Note that, when adding the `read` flag to messages, clients should
                    consider including a narrow with the `is:unread` filter as an
                    optimization. Including that filter takes advantage of the fact that
                    the server has a database index for unread messages.

        Check whether a set of messages match a [narrow](/api/construct-narrow).

        For many common narrows (e.g. a topic), clients can write an efficient
        client-side check to determine whether a newly arrived message belongs
        in the view.

        This endpoint is designed to allow clients to handle more complex narrows
        for which the client does not (or in the case of full-text search, cannot)
        implement this check.

        The format of the `match_subject` and `match_content` objects is designed
        to match those returned by the [`GET /messages`](/api/get-messages#response)
        endpoint, so that a client can splice these fields into a `message` object
        received from [`GET /events`](/api/get-events#message) and end up with an
        extended message object identical to how a [`GET /messages`](/api/get-messages)
        request for the current narrow would have returned the message.

        useful for clients that primarily work with HTML-rendered

        prefilling a message edit textarea).

                                  `stream_wildcard_mentioned || topic_wildcard_mentioned`. Clients
                                  supporting older server versions should treat this field as a previous
                                  name for the `stream_wildcard_mentioned` flag as topic wildcard mentions
                                  were not available prior to this feature level.

        Update the content, topic, or channel of the message with the specified
        ID.

        You can [resolve topics](/help/resolve-a-topic) by editing the topic to
        `✔ {original_topic}` with the `propagate_mode` parameter set to
        `"change_all"`.

        See [configuring message editing][config-message-editing] for detailed
        documentation on when users are allowed to edit message content, and
        [restricting moving messages][restrict-move-messages] for detailed
        documentation on when users are allowed to change a message's topic
        and/or channel.

        The relevant realm settings in the API that are related to the above
        linked documentation on when users are allowed to update messages are:

        - `allow_message_editing`
        - `can_resolve_topics_group`
        - `can_move_messages_between_channels_group`
        - `can_move_messages_between_topics_group`
        - `message_content_edit_limit_seconds`
        - `move_messages_within_stream_limit_seconds`
        - `move_messages_between_streams_limit_seconds`

        More details about these realm settings can be found in the
        [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) response or in the documentation
        of the [`realm op: update_dict`](/api/get-events#realm-update_dict)
        event in [`GET /events`](/api/get-events).

        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 10.0 (feature level 367), the permission for
        resolving a topic was managed by `can_move_messages_between_topics_group`.
        As of this feature level, users belonging to the `can_resolve_topics_group`
        will have the permission to [resolve topics](/help/resolve-a-topic) in the organization.

        In Zulip 10.0 (feature level 316), `edit_topic_policy`
        was removed and replaced by `can_move_messages_between_topics_group`
        realm setting.

        **Changes**: In Zulip 10.0 (feature level 310), `move_messages_between_streams_policy`
        was removed and replaced by `can_move_messages_between_channels_group`
        realm setting.

        Prior to Zulip 7.0 (feature level 172), anyone could add a
        topic to channel messages without a topic, regardless of the organization's
        [topic editing permissions](/help/restrict-moving-messages). As of this
        feature level, messages without topics have the same restrictions for
        topic edits as messages with topics.

        Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 172), by using the `change_all` value for
        the `propagate_mode` parameter, users could move messages after the
        organization's configured time limits for changing a message's topic or
        channel had passed. As of this feature level, the server will [return an
        error](/api/update-message#response) with `"code":
        "MOVE_MESSAGES_TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"` if users, other than organization
        administrators or moderators, try to move messages after these time
        limits have passed.

        Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 162), users who were not administrators or
        moderators could only edit topics if the target message was sent within the
        last 3 days. As of this feature level, that time limit is now controlled by
        the realm setting `move_messages_within_stream_limit_seconds`. Also at this
        feature level, a similar time limit for moving messages between channels was
        added, controlled by the realm setting
        `move_messages_between_streams_limit_seconds`. Previously, all users who
        had permission to move messages between channels did not have any time limit
        restrictions when doing so.

        Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 159), editing channels and topics of messages
        was forbidden if the realm setting for `allow_message_editing` was `false`,
        regardless of an organization's configuration for the realm settings
        `edit_topic_policy` or `move_messages_between_streams_policy`.

        Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 159), message senders were allowed to edit
        the topic of their messages indefinitely.

        In Zulip 5.0 (feature level 75), the `edit_topic_policy` realm setting
        was added, replacing the `allow_community_topic_editing` boolean.

        In Zulip 4.0 (feature level 56), the `move_messages_between_streams_policy`
        realm setting was added.

                    The topic to move the message(s) to, to request changing the topic.

                    Clients should use the `max_topic_length` returned by the
                    [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) endpoint to determine
                    the maximum topic length

                    Should only be sent when changing the topic, and will throw an error
                    if the target message is not a channel message.

                    Note: When the value of `realm_empty_topic_display_name` found in
                    the [POST /register](/api/register-queue) response is used for this
                    parameter, it is interpreted as an empty string.

                    When [topics are required](/help/require-topics), this parameter can't
                    be `"(no topic)"`, an empty string, or the value of `realm_empty_topic_display_name`.

                    You can [resolve topics](/help/resolve-a-topic) by editing the topic to
                    `✔ {original_topic}` with the `propagate_mode` parameter set to
                    `"change_all"`. The empty string topic cannot be marked as resolved.

                    **Changes**: Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 334), empty string
                    was not a valid topic name for channel messages.

                    Only the default value of `"change_one"` is valid when editing
                    only the content of a message.

                    This parameter determines both which messages get moved and also whether
                    clients that are currently narrowed to the topic containing the message

                    If provided, the server will return an error if it does not match the
                    SHA-256 hash of the message's content stored in the database.

                    Note that a message's content and channel cannot be changed at the

                          A special failed JSON response (`"code": "MOVE_MESSAGES_TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"`)
                          for when the user has permission to move
                          the target message, but asked to move all messages in a topic
                          (`"propagate_mode": "change_all"`) and the user does not have permission
                          to move the entire topic.

                          This happens when the topic contains some messages that are older than an
                          applicable time limit for the requested topic move (see
                          `move_messages_within_stream_limit_seconds` and/or
                          `move_messages_between_streams_limit_seconds` in the
                          [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) response).

                          The error response contains data on which portion of this topic the user has
                          permission to move. `first_message_id_allowed_to_move` is the oldest message
                          ID in this topic that the user has permission to move.
                          There are `total_messages_in_topic` in the topic, but the user only has
                          permission to move the (most recent) `total_messages_allowed_to_move`
                          messages.

                          Clients should support this error code with
                          `"first_message_id_allowed_to_move": null` for forward compatibility
                          with future server versions that may use this error code with other
                          propagation modes where the user does not have permission to move any
                          messages, or where the server did not calculate the total message counts
                          noted above.

                          Clients can either only present the error to the user or, if
                          `first_message_id_allowed_to_move` is not `null`, prompt the user to adjust
                          their query with the above information.

                          If clients choose to present a prompt for this error code, they should
                          recommend the option of cancelling and (manually) asking a moderator to
                          move the entire topic, since that's often a better experience than
                          partially moving a topic. This API supports a client that wishes to allow
                          the user to repeat the request with a `change_later` propagation mode and
                          a target message ID of `first_message_id_allowed_to_move`, if the user
                          desires to move only the portion of the topic that they can.

                          Note that in a [private channel with protected history][private-channels],
                          the Zulip security model requires that the above calculations only include
                          messages the acting user has access to. So in the rare case of a user
                          attempting to move a topic that started before the user joined a private
                          channel with protected history, this API endpoint might move only the portion
                          of a topic that they have access to, without this error or any confirmation
                          dialog.

        Permanently delete a message.

        This API corresponds to the [delete a message completely][delete-completely]
        feature documented in the Zulip help center.

        A user must be able to access the content of a message in order to delete it.
        See [channel permissions](/help/channel-permissions) for more information
        about content access for channel messages. For direct messages, the user
        must have received or sent the direct message to have content access.

        See [restricting message deletion](/help/restrict-message-editing-and-deletion)
        for documentation on when users are allowed to delete messages.

        The relevant realm settings in the API that are related to the above linked
        documentation on when users are allowed to delete messages are:

        - `realm_can_delete_any_message_group`
        - `realm_can_delete_own_message_group`
        - `realm_can_set_delete_message_policy_group`
        - `realm_message_content_delete_limit_seconds`

        The relevant per-channel permission settings in the API that are related to the
        above linked documentation on when users are allowed to delete messages in a
        specific channel are:

        - `can_delete_any_message_group`
        - `can_delete_own_message_group`

        More details about these realm and channel settings can be found in the
        [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) response.

        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 10.0 (feature level 281), only organization
        administrators had permission to permanently delete a message.

        Clients should check the `moderation_request_channel` realm setting to
        decide whether to show the option to report messages in the UI.

        If the `report_type` parameter value is `"other"`, the `description`

        behavior in the UI.

        [Upload](/help/share-and-upload-files) a single file and get the corresponding URL.

        Initially, only you will be able to access the link. To share the
        uploaded file, you'll need to [send a message][send-message]
        containing the resulting link. Users who can already access the link
        can reshare it with other users by sending additional Zulip messages
        containing the link.

        The maximum allowed file size is available in the `max_file_upload_size_mib`
        field in the [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) response. Note that
        large files (25MB+) may fail to upload using this API endpoint due to
        network-layer timeouts, depending on the quality of your connection to the
        Zulip server.

        For uploading larger files, `/api/v1/tus` is an endpoint implementing the
        [`tus` resumable upload protocol](https://tus.io/protocols/resumable-upload),
        which supports uploading arbitrarily large files limited only by the server's
        `max_file_upload_size_mib` (Configured via `MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE` in
        `/etc/zulip/settings.py`). Clients which send authenticated credentials
        (either via browser-based cookies, or API key via `Authorization` header) may
        use this endpoint to upload files.

        **Changes**: The `api/v1/tus` endpoint supporting resumable uploads was
        introduced in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 296). Previously,
        `max_file_upload_size_mib` was typically 25MB.

                          Clients generating a Markdown link to a newly uploaded file
                          should do so by combining the `url` and `filename` fields in the

            **Note**: On Zulip Cloud, this feature is available only for
            organizations on a [Zulip Cloud Standard](https://zulip.com/plans/)
            or [Zulip Cloud Plus](https://zulip.com/plans/) plan. Administrators
            can request the required `can_create_users` permission for a bot or
            user by contacting [Zulip Cloud support][support] with an
            explanation for why it is needed. Self-hosted installations can
            toggle `can_create_users` on an account using the `manage.py
            change_user_role` [management command][management-commands].

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 4.0 (feature level 36), this endpoint was
        available to all organization administrators.

        This endpoint is most useful for embedding data about a user's
        presence status in other sites (e.g. an employee directory). Full
        Zulip clients like mobile/desktop apps will want to use the [main
        presence endpoint](/api/get-presence), which returns data for all
        active users in the organization, instead.

                            contain two keys, `"website"` and `"aggregated"`, with identical data. The
                            server no longer stores which client submitted presence updates.

                            Previously, the `{client_name}` keys for these objects were the names of the
                            different clients where the user was logged in, for example `website` or
                            `ZulipDesktop`.

                          user's account.

                          **Deprecated**. We plan to remove this in favor of recommending
                          using `GET /messages` with `"anchor": "newest"`.
                        example: 30

                          The requesting user's real email address.

                          **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 7.0 (feature level 163), this field was
                          present only when `email_address_visibility` was restricted and the
                          requesting user had permission to access realm users' emails. As of
                          this feature level, this field is always present.

                          another chat system. Stub accounts are used to represent the senders
                          for imported messages. Stub accounts can be converted to regular Zulip
                          accounts when the user starts using Zulip, preserving that imported
                          user's message history.

                          **Changes**: New in Zulip 12.0 (feature level 433).

        Update the current user's [presence][availability] and fetch presence data
        of other users in the organization.

        This endpoint is meant to be used by clients for both:

        - Reporting the current user's presence status (`"active"` or `"idle"`)
          to the server.

        - Obtaining the presence data of all other users in the organization via
          regular polling.

        Accurate user presence is one of the most expensive parts of any
        chat application (in terms of bandwidth and other resources). Therefore,
        it is important that clients implementing Zulip's user presence system
        use the modern [`last_update_id`](#parameter-last_update_id) protocol to
        minimize fetching duplicate user presence data.

        Client apps implementing presence are recommended to also consume [`presence`
        events](/api/get-events#presence)), in order to learn about newly online users
        immediately.

        The Zulip server is responsible for implementing [invisible mode][invisible],
        which disables sharing a user's presence data. Nonetheless, clients
        should check the `presence_enabled` field in user objects in order to
        display the current user as online or offline based on whether they are
        sharing their presence information.

        **Changes**: As of Zulip 8.0 (feature level 228), if the
        `CAN_ACCESS_ALL_USERS_GROUP_LIMITS_PRESENCE` server-level setting is
        `true`, then user presence data in the response is [limited to users
        the current user can see/access][limit-visibility].

                  type: integer
                  description: |
                    The identifier that specifies what presence data the client already
                    has received, which allows the server to only return more recent
                    user presence data.

                    This should be set to `-1` during initialization of the client in
                    order to fetch all user presence data, unless the client is obtaining
                    initial user presence metadata from the
                    [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) endpoint.

                    In subsequent queries to this endpoint, this value should be set to the
                    most recent value of `presence_last_update_id` returned by the server
                    in this endpoint's response, which implements incremental fetching
                    of user presence data.

                    When this parameter is passed, the user presence data in the response
                    will always be in the modern format.

                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 263). Previously, the
                    server sent user presence data for all users who had been active in the
                    last two weeks unconditionally.
                  example: 5
                history_limit_days:
                  type: integer
                  description: |
                    Limits how far back in time to fetch user presence data. If not specified,
                    defaults to 14 days. A value of N means that the oldest presence data
                    fetched will be from at most N days ago.

                    Note that this is only useful during the initial user presence data fetch,
                    as subsequent fetches should use the `last_update_id` parameter, which
                    will act as the limit on how much presence data is returned. `history_limit_days`
                    is ignored if `last_update_id` is passed with a value greater than `0`,
                    indicating that the client already has some presence data.

                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 288).
                  example: 365
                new_user_input:
                  type: boolean
                  description: |
                    Whether the user has interacted with the client (e.g. moved the mouse,
                    used the keyboard, etc.) since the previous presence request from this
                    client.

                    The server uses data from this parameter to implement certain [usage
                    statistics](/help/analytics).

                    User interface clients that might run in the background, without the
                    user ever interacting with them, should be careful to only pass `true`
                    if the user has actually interacted with the client in order to avoid
                    corrupting usage statistics graphs.
                  example: false
                  default: false
                ping_only:
                  type: boolean
                  description: |
                    Whether the client is sending a ping-only request, meaning it only
                    wants to update the user's presence `status` on the server.

                    Otherwise, also requests the server return user presence data for all
                    users in the organization, which is further specified by the
                    [`last_update_id`](#parameter-last_update_id) parameter.
                  example: false
                  default: false
                slim_presence:

                    Legacy parameter for configuring the format (modern or legacy) in
                    which the server will return user presence data for the organization.

                    Modern clients should use
                    [`last_update_id`](#parameter-last_update_id), which guarantees that
                    user presence data will be returned in the modern format, and
                    should not pass this parameter as `true` unless interacting with an
                    older server.

                    Legacy clients that do not yet support `last_update_id` may use the
                    value of `true` to request the modern format for user presence data.

                    **Note**: The legacy format for user presence data will be removed
                    entirely in a future release.

                    **Changes**: **Deprecated** in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 263). Using
                    the modern `last_update_id` parameter is the recommended way to
                    request the modern format for user presence data.

                    New in Zulip 3.0 (no feature level as it was an unstable API at that
                    point).
                  example: false
                  default: false
                  deprecated: true

                  description: |
                    The status of the user on this client.

                    Clients should report the user as `"active"` on this device if the client
                    knows that the user is presently using the device (and thus would
                    potentially see a notification immediately), even if the user
                    has not directly interacted with the Zulip client.

                    Otherwise, it should report the user as `"idle"`.

                    See the related [`new_user_input`](#parameter-new_user_input) parameter
                    for how a client should report whether the user is actively using the
                    Zulip client.

                          The identifier for the latest user presence data returned in
                          the `presences` data of the response.

                          If a value was passed for `last_update_id`, then this is
                          guaranteed to be equal to or greater than that value. If it
                          is the same value, then that indicates to the client that
                          there were no updates to previously received user presence
                          data.

                          The client should then pass this value as the `last_update_id`
                          parameter when it next queries this endpoint, in order to only
                          receive new user presence data and avoid redundantly fetching
                          already known information.

                          This will be `-1` if no value was passed for
                          [`last_update_id`](#parameter-last_update_id) and no user
                          presence data was returned by the server. This can happen, for
                          example, if an organization has disabled presence.

                          of a user in the Zulip organization. Entries can be in either
                          the modern presence format or the legacy presence format.

                          These entries will be the modern presence format when the
                          `last_updated_id` parameter is passed, or when the deprecated
                          `slim_presence` parameter is `true`.

                          If the deprecated `slim_presence` parameter is `false` and the
                          `last_updated_id` parameter is omitted, the entries will be in
                          the legacy presence API format.

                          **Note**: The legacy presence format should only be used when
                          interacting with old servers. It will be removed as soon as
                          doing so is practical.

        Change your [status](/help/status-and-availability).

        A request to this endpoint will only change the parameters passed.
        For example, passing just `status_text` requests a change in the status
        text, but will leave the status emoji unchanged.

        Clients that wish to set the user's status to a specific value should
        pass all supported parameters.

        **Changes**: In Zulip 5.0 (feature level 86), added support for
        `emoji_name`, `emoji_code`, and `reaction_type` parameters.

                    The text content of the status message. Sending the empty string
                    will clear the user's status.

                    **Note**: The limit on the size of the message is 60 characters.
                  example: on vacation

                    Whether the user should be marked as "away".

                    **Changes**: Deprecated in Zulip 6.0 (feature level 148);
                    starting with that feature level, `away` is a legacy way to
                    access the user's `presence_enabled` setting, with
                    `away = !presence_enabled`. To be removed in a future release.
                  example: true
                emoji_name:
                  type: string
                  description: |
                    The name for the emoji to associate with this status.

                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 86).
                  example: car
                emoji_code:
                  type: string

                    A unique identifier, defining the specific emoji codepoint requested,
                    within the namespace of the `reaction_type`.

                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 86).

                    A string indicating the type of emoji. Each emoji `reaction_type`
                    has an independent namespace for values of `emoji_code`.

                    Must be one of the following values:

                    - `unicode_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be a
                      dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
                      that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

                    - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
                      the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

                    - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Zulip.
                      In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.
                      "zulip").

                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 86).

        Subscribe one or more users to one or more channels.

        If any of the specified channels do not exist, they are automatically
        created. The initial [channel settings](/api/update-stream) will be determined
        by the optional parameters, like `invite_only`, detailed below.

        Note that the ability to subscribe oneself and/or other users
        to a specified channel depends on the [channel's permissions
        settings](/help/channel-permissions).

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 362),
        subscriptions in archived channels could not be modified.

        Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 357), the
        `can_subscribe_group` permission, which allows members of the
        group to subscribe themselves to the channel, did not exist.

        Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 349), a user cannot subscribe
        other users to a private channel without being subscribed
        to that channel themselves. Now, If a user is part of
        `can_add_subscribers_group`, they can subscribe themselves or other
        users to a private channel without being subscribed to that channel.

        Removed `stream_post_policy` and `is_announcement_only`
        parameters in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 333), as permission to post
        in the channel is now controlled by `can_send_message_group`.

        Before Zulip 8.0 (feature level 208), if a user specified by the
        [`principals`][principals-param] parameter was a deactivated user,
        or did not exist, then an HTTP status code of 403 was returned with
        `code: "UNAUTHORIZED_PRINCIPAL"` in the error response. As of this
        feature level, an HTTP status code of 400 is returned with
        `code: "BAD_REQUEST"` in the error response for these cases.

                    be specified by setting the dictionary key `description` with an

      description: |
        Unsubscribe yourself or other users from one or more channels.

        In addition to managing the current user's subscriptions, this
        endpoint can be used to remove other users from channels. This
        is possible in 3 situations:

        - Organization administrators can remove any user from any
          channel.
        - Users can remove a bot that they own from any channel that
          the user [can access](/help/channel-permissions).
        - Users can unsubscribe any user from a channel if they [have
          access](/help/channel-permissions) to the channel and are a
          member of the [user group](/api/get-user-groups) specified
          by the [`can_remove_subscribers_group`][can-remove-parameter]
          for the channel.

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 362),
        subscriptions in archived channels could not be modified.

        Before Zulip 8.0 (feature level 208), if a user specified by
        the [`principals`][principals-param] parameter was a
        deactivated user, or did not exist, then an HTTP status code
        of 403 was returned with `code: "UNAUTHORIZED_PRINCIPAL"` in
        the error response. As of this feature level, an HTTP status
        code of 400 is returned with `code: "BAD_REQUEST"` in the
        error response for these cases.

        Before Zulip 8.0 (feature level 197),
        the `can_remove_subscribers_group` setting
        was named `can_remove_subscribers_group_id`.

        Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 161), the
        `can_remove_subscribers_group_id` for all channels was always
        the system group for organization administrators.

        Before Zulip 6.0 (feature level 145), users had no special
        privileges for managing bots that they own.

        feature level, all mobile push notifications now include a
        `realm_name` field.

                    Key that the client would like the server to use to encrypt notifications,
                    encoded with Base64.

                    The key is a byte sequence beginning with a single byte that encodes which
                    cryptosystem to use, followed by the key to use for that cryptosystem.
                    This byte sequence is encoded using standard Base64 encoding as defined in RFC 4648.

                    The client should avoid sharing the key anywhere else: in particular it should
                    generate a fresh key for each server, and to the extent possible keep the key
                    out of any backups of the client's data.

                    Supported cryptosystems are:

                    - `0x31`: LibSodium's [SecretBox][libsodium-secretbox] symmetric key encryption
                      system. Keys are 32 bytes, which the server will use with libsodium's
                      `crypto_secretbox_easy`. See the [NaCl documentation][nacl-secretbox], which
                      details how this system uses `XSalsa20` and `Poly1305` to provide authenticated
                      encryption.

                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 12.0 (feature level 432). This replaced the
                    `push_public_key` parameter which had a prototype asymmetric cryptosystem, and
                    did not have a natural way to support multiple cryptosystems.

                    Which of the bouncer's public keys the client used to encrypt the
                    `PushRegistration` dictionary.

                    When the bouncer rotates the key, a new asymmetric key pair is created,
                    and the new public key is baked into a new client release. Because
                    the bouncer routinely rotates key, this field clarifies which
                    public key the client is using.

                    base64 encoder.

                    The `PushRegistration` dictionary contains the fields `token`,
                    `token_kind`, `timestamp`, and (for iOS devices) `ios_app_id`.

        toggling whether a topic was muted or unmuted was managed by the
        [PATCH /users/me/subscriptions/muted_topics](/api/mute-topic) endpoint.

                  example: 1
                topic:
                  description: |
                    The topic for which the personal preferences needs to be updated.
                    Note that the request will succeed regardless of whether
                    any messages have been sent to the specified topic.

                    Clients should use the `max_topic_length` returned by the
                    [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) endpoint to determine
                    the maximum topic length.

                    Note: When the value of `realm_empty_topic_display_name` found in
                    the [POST /register](/api/register-queue) response is used for this
                    parameter, it is interpreted as an empty string.

                    **Changes**: Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 334), empty string
                    was not a valid topic name for channel messages.
                  type: string
                  example: dinner
                visibility_policy:
                  description: |
                    Controls which visibility policy to set.

                    - 0 = None. Removes the visibility policy previously set for the topic.
                    - 1 = Muted. [Mutes the topic](/help/mute-a-topic) in a channel.
                    - 2 = Unmuted. [Unmutes the topic](/help/mute-a-topic) in a muted channel.
                    - 3 = Followed. [Follows the topic](/help/follow-a-topic).

                    In an unmuted channel, a topic visibility policy of unmuted will have the
                    same effect as the "None" visibility policy.

                    **Changes**: In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 219), added followed as
                    a visibility policy option.

        [Mute a user](/help/mute-a-user) from the perspective of the requesting
        user. Messages sent by muted users will be automatically marked as read
        and hidden for the user who muted them.

        Muted users should be implemented by clients as follows:

        - The server will immediately mark all messages sent by the muted
          user as read. This will automatically clear any existing mobile
          push notifications related to the muted user.
        - The server will mark any new messages sent by the muted user as read
          for the requesting user's account, which prevents all email and mobile
          push notifications.
        - Clients should exclude muted users from presence lists or other UI
          for viewing or composing one-on-one direct messages. One-on-one direct
          messages sent by muted users should be hidden everywhere in the Zulip UI.
        - Channel messages and group direct messages sent by the muted
          user should avoid displaying the content and name/avatar,
          but should display that N messages by a muted user were
          hidden (so that it is possible to interpret the messages by
          other users who are talking with the muted user).
        - Group direct message conversations including the muted user
          should display muted users as "Muted user", rather than
          showing their name, in lists of such conversations, along with using
          a blank grey avatar where avatars are displayed.
        - Administrative/settings UI elements for showing "All users that exist
          on this channel or realm", e.g. for organization
          administration or showing channel subscribers, should display
          the user's name as normal.

        The [channel security model](/help/channel-permissions) means only those
        subscribed channels to which the acting user has metadata access are
        returned.

        For organization administrators, this is guaranteed to be all channels
        the target user is subscribed to, since organization administrators
        implicitly have metadata access to all channels.

        This endpoint is used to upload a custom emoji for use in the user's

        As described above, the image file to upload must be provided in the

        ## Maximum file size

        The maximum file size for uploads can be configured by the
        administrator of the Zulip server by setting `MAX_EMOJI_FILE_SIZE_MIB`
        in the [server's settings][1]. `MAX_EMOJI_FILE_SIZE_MIB` defaults

            are treated the same as spaces (consistent with how the Zulip UI
            handles emoji).

                    For field type 3 (List of options), this attribute is a JSON dictionary
                    defining the choices and the order they will be displayed in the
                    dropdown UI for individual users to select an option.

                    At most 2 profile fields may have this property be true in a given
                    organization. The "Long text" [profile field types][profile-field-types]
                    profile field types cannot be selected to be displayed in profile summaries.

                    The "Person picker" profile field is also not supported, but that is likely to
                    be temporary.

                    Because the required property is mutable, clients cannot assume that a required
                    custom profile field has a value. The Zulip web application displays a prominent
                    banner to any user who has not set a value for a required field.

        Change the [default values of settings][new-user-defaults] for new users

        [personal preference settings](/api/update-settings) are supported.

        This feature can be invaluable for customizing Zulip's default
        settings for notifications or UI to be appropriate for how the
        organization is using Zulip. (Note that this only supports
        personal preference settings, like when to send push
        notifications or what emoji set to use, not profile or
        identity settings that naturally should be different for each user).

        Note that this endpoint cannot, at present, be used to modify
        settings for existing users in any way.

        **Changes**: Removed `dense_mode` setting in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 364)
        as we now have `web_font_size_px` and `web_line_height_percent`
        settings for more control.

        New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 96). If any parameters sent in the
        request are not supported by this endpoint, an
        [`ignored_parameters_unsupported`][ignored-parameters] array will
        be returned in the JSON success response.

                    way for the user to configure this behavior on the web, and the Zulip web and

                    When enabled, clients should display the names of reacting users, rather than
                    a count, for messages with few total reactions. The ideal cutoff may depend on
                    the space available for displaying reactions; the official web application
                    displays names when 3 or fewer total reactions are present with this setting

                          One of the channel properties described below:

                          - `"color"`: The hex value of the user's display color for the channel.

                          - `"is_muted"`: Whether the channel is [muted](/help/mute-a-channel).<br>
                            **Changes**: As of Zulip 6.0 (feature level 139), updating either
                            `"is_muted"` or `"in_home_view"` generates two [subscription update
                            events](/api/get-events#subscription-update), one for each property,
                            that are sent to clients. Prior to this feature level, updating either
                            property only generated a subscription update event for
                            `"in_home_view"`. <br>
                            Prior to Zulip 2.1.0, this feature was represented
                            by the more confusingly named `"in_home_view"` (with the
                            opposite value: `in_home_view=!is_muted`); for
                            backwards-compatibility, modern Zulip still accepts that property.

                          - `"pin_to_top"`: Whether to pin the channel at the top of the channel list.

                          - `"desktop_notifications"`: Whether to show desktop notifications
                            for all messages sent to the channel.

                          - `"audible_notifications"`: Whether to play a sound
                            notification for all messages sent to the channel.

                          - `"push_notifications"`: Whether to trigger a mobile push
                            notification for all messages sent to the channel.

                          - `"email_notifications"`: Whether to trigger an email
                            notification for all messages sent to the channel.

                          - `"wildcard_mentions_notify"`: Whether wildcard mentions trigger
                            notifications as though they were personal mentions in this channel.

      description: |
        Fetch details for a single user in the organization given a Zulip
        API email address.

        You can also fetch details on [all users in the organization](/api/get-users)
        or [by user ID](/api/get-user).

        Fetching by user ID is generally recommended when possible,
        as a user might [change their email address](/help/change-your-email-address)
        or change their [email address visibility](/help/configure-email-visibility),
        either of which could change the client's ability to look them up by that
        email address.

        **Changes**: In Zulip 12.0 (feature level 437), fixed a bug
        dating to feature level 232, which caused guest users to
        receive fake backwards-compatibility users in the format
        intended for clients using `POST /register` without the
        `user_list_incomplete` client capability.

        Starting with Zulip 10.0 (feature level 302), the real email
        address can be used in the `email` parameter and will fetch the target user's
        data if and only if the target's email visibility setting permits the requester
        to see the email address.
        The dummy email addresses of the form `user{id}@{realm.host}` still work, and
        will now work for **all** users, via identifying them by the embedded user ID.

        New in Zulip Server 4.0 (feature level 39).

            The email address of the user to fetch. Two forms are supported:

            - The real email address of the user (`delivery_email`). The lookup will
              succeed if and only if the user exists and their email address visibility
              setting permits the client to see the email address.

            - The dummy Zulip API email address of the form `user{user_id}@{realm_host}`. This
              is identical to simply [getting user by ID](/api/get-user). If the server or
              realm change domains, the dummy email address used has to be adjustment to
              match the new realm domain. This is legacy behavior for
              backwards-compatibility, and will be removed in a future release.

            **Changes**: Starting with Zulip 10.0 (feature level 302), lookups by real email
            address match the semantics of the target's email visibility setting and dummy
            email addresses work for all users, independently of their email visibility
            setting.

            Previously, lookups were done only using the Zulip API email addresses.

        Administrative endpoint to update the details of another user in the organization by their email address.
        Works the same way as [`PATCH /users/{user_id}`](/api/update-user) but fetching the target user by their
        real email address.

        The requester needs to have permission to view the target user's real email address, subject to the
        user's email address visibility setting. Otherwise, the dummy address of the format
        `user{id}@{realm.host}` needs be used. This follows the same rules as `GET /users/{email}`.

                    be subscribed to based on the `include_realm_default_subscriptions`
                    parameter.

                    Requested channels must either be default channels for the

                    subscribers to would be rejected.

                    Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 180), specifying `stream_ids` as an
                    empty list resulted in an error.

    post:
      operationId: register-queue
      summary: Register an event queue
      tags: ["real_time_events"]
      description: |
        This powerful endpoint can be used to register a Zulip "event queue"
        (subscribed to certain types of "events", or updates to the messages
        and other Zulip data the current user has access to), as well as to
        fetch the current state of that data.

        (`register` also powers the `call_on_each_event` Python API, and is
        intended primarily for complex applications for which the more convenient
        `call_on_each_event` API is insufficient).

        This endpoint returns a `queue_id` and a `last_event_id`; these can be
        used in subsequent calls to the
        ["events" endpoint](/api/get-events) to request events from
        the Zulip server using long-polling.

        The server will queue events for up to 10 minutes of inactivity.
        After 10 minutes, your event queue will be garbage-collected. The
        server will send `heartbeat` events every minute, which makes it easy
        to implement a robust client that does not miss events unless the
        client loses network connectivity with the Zulip server for 10 minutes
        or longer.

        Once the server garbage-collects your event queue, the server will
        [return an error](/api/get-events#bad_event_queue_id-errors)
        with a code of `BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID` if you try to fetch events from
        the event queue. Your software will need to handle that error
        condition by re-initializing itself (e.g. this is what triggers your
        browser reloading the Zulip web app when your laptop comes back online
        after being offline for more than 10 minutes).

        When prototyping with this API, we recommend first calling `register`
        with no `event_types` parameter to see all the available data from all
        supported event types. Before using your client in production, you
        should set appropriate `event_types` and `fetch_event_types` filters
        so that your client only requests the data it needs. A few minutes
        doing this often saves 90% of the total bandwidth and other resources
        consumed by a client using this API.

        See the [events system developer documentation][events-system-docs]
        if you need deeper details about how the Zulip event queue system
        works, avoids clients needing to worry about large classes of
        potentially messy races, etc.

        **Changes**: Removed `dense_mode` setting in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 364)
        as we now have `web_font_size_px` and `web_line_height_percent`
        settings for more control.

        Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 183), the
        `realm_community_topic_editing_limit_seconds` property
        was returned by the response. It was removed because it
        had not been in use since the realm setting
        `move_messages_within_stream_limit_seconds` was introduced
        in feature level 162.

        In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 163), the realm setting
        `email_address_visibility` was removed. It was replaced by a [user
        setting](/api/update-settings#parameter-email_address_visibility) with
        a [realm user default][user-defaults], with the encoding of different
        values preserved. Clients can support all versions by supporting the
        current API and treating every user as having the realm's
        `email_address_visibility` value.

                    if there is a Zulip avatar, and will be `null` for users who
                    are using gravatar as their avatar. This option
                    significantly reduces the compressed size of user data,
                    since gravatar URLs are long, random strings and thus do not
                    compress well. The `client_gravatar` field is set to `true` if
                    clients can compute their own gravatars.

                    The default value is `true` for authenticated requests and

                    an unauthenticated request is an error.

                    were `false` in unauthenticated requests.

                    Client apps supporting organizations with many thousands of users
                    should not pass `true`, because the full subscriber matrix may be
                    several megabytes of data. The `partial` value, combined with the
                    `subscriber_count` and fetching subscribers for individual channels as
                    needed, is recommended to support client app features where channel
                    subscriber data is useful.

                    If a client passes `partial` for this parameter, the server may,
                    for some channels, return a subset of the channel's subscribers
                    in the `partial_subscribers` field instead of the `subscribers` field,
                    which always contains the complete set of subscribers.

                    The server guarantees that it will always return a `subscribers`
                    field for channels with fewer than 250 total subscribers. When
                    returning a `partial_subscribers` field, the server guarantees
                    that all bot users and users active within the last 14 days will
                    be included. For other cases, the server may use its discretion
                    to determine which channels and users to include, balancing between
                    payload size and usefulness of the data provided to the client.

                    Passing `true` in an [unauthenticated
                    request](/help/public-access-option) is an error.

                    **Changes**: The `partial` value is new in Zulip 11.0 (feature level 412).

                    Before Zulip 6.0 (feature level 149), this parameter was silently
                    ignored and processed as though it were `false` in unauthenticated
                    requests.

                    New in Zulip 2.1.0.

                    by user ID and the entry for each user's presence data will be in the
                    modern format.

                    Dictionary containing details on features the client supports that are
                    relevant to the format of responses sent by the server.

                    - `notification_settings_null`: Boolean for whether the
                      client can handle the current API with `null` values for
                      channel-level notification settings (which means the channel
                      is not customized and should inherit the user's global
                      notification settings for channel messages).
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 2.1.0. In earlier Zulip releases,
                      channel-level notification settings were simple booleans.

                    - `bulk_message_deletion`: Boolean for whether the client's
                      handler for the `delete_message` event type has been
                      updated to process the new bulk format (with a
                      `message_ids`, rather than a singleton `message_id`).
                      Otherwise, the server will send `delete_message` events
                      in a loop.
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 13). This
                      capability is for backwards-compatibility; it will be
                      required in a future server release.

                    - `user_avatar_url_field_optional`: Boolean for whether the
                      client required avatar URLs for all users, or supports
                      using `GET /avatar/{user_id}` to access user avatars. If the
                      client has this capability, the server may skip sending a
                      `avatar_url` field in the `realm_user` at its sole discretion
                      to optimize network performance. This is an important optimization
                      in organizations with 10,000s of users.
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 18).

                    - `stream_typing_notifications`: Boolean for whether the client
                      supports channel typing notifications.
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58). This capability is
                      for backwards-compatibility; it will be required in a
                      future server release.

                    - `user_settings_object`: Has no effect with modern servers. Previously, this
                      was a boolean for whether the client supported the modern `user_settings` event type.
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 12.0 (feature level 439), if false, the server
                      would additionally send the legacy `update_global_notifications` and
                      `update_display_settings` event types if requested.

                      New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 89). Because the feature level 89 API changes
                      were merged together, clients can safely make a request with this client
                      capability and also request all three event types (`user_settings`,
                      `update_display_settings`, `update_global_notifications`), and get exactly one
                      copy of settings data on any server version. Clients can then use the
                      `zulip_feature_level` in the `/register` response or the presence/absence of a
                      `user_settings` key to determine where to look for the data.

                    - `linkifier_url_template`: Boolean for whether the client accepts
                      [linkifiers][help-linkifiers] that use [RFC 6570][rfc6570] compliant
                      URL templates for linkifying matches. If false or unset, then the
                      `realm_linkifiers` array in the `/register` response will be empty
                      if present, and no `realm_linkifiers` [events][events-linkifiers]
                      will be sent to the client.
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 7.0 (feature level 176). This capability
                      is for backwards-compatibility.

                    - `user_list_incomplete`: Boolean for whether the client supports not having an
                      incomplete user database. If true, then the `realm_users` array in the `register`
                      response will not include data for inaccessible users and clients of guest users will
                      not receive `realm_user op:add` events for newly created users that are not accessible
                      to the current user.
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 8.0 (feature level 232). This
                      capability is for backwards-compatibility.

                    - `include_deactivated_groups`: Boolean for whether the client can handle
                      deactivated user groups by themselves. If false, then the `realm_user_groups`
                      array in the `/register` response will only include active groups, clients
                      will receive a `remove` event instead of `update` event when a group is
                      deactivated and no `update` event will be sent to the client if a deactivated
                      user group is renamed.
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 294). This
                      capability is for backwards-compatibility.

                    - `archived_channels`: Boolean for whether the client supports processing
                      [archived channels](/help/archive-a-channel) in the `stream` and
                      `subscription` event types. If `false`, the server will not include data
                      related to archived channels in the `register` response or in events.
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 315). This allows clients to
                      access archived channels, without breaking backwards-compatibility for
                      existing clients.

                    - `empty_topic_name`: Boolean for whether the client supports processing
                      the empty string as a topic name. Clients not declaring this capability
                      will be sent the value of `realm_empty_topic_display_name` found in the
                      [POST /register](/api/register-queue) response instead of the empty string
                      wherever topic names appear in the register response or events involving
                      topic names.
                      <br/>
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 334). Previously,
                      the empty string was not a valid topic name.

                    - `simplified_presence_events`: Boolean for whether the client supports
                      receiving the [`presence` event type](/api/get-events#presence) with
                      user presence data in the modern format. If true, the server will
                      send these events with the `presences` field that has the user presence
                      data in the modern format. Otherwise, these event will contain fields
                      with legacy format user presence data.
                      <br />
                      **Changes**: New in Zulip 11.0 (feature level 419).

                          in this Zulip organization. This must be combined with the custom profile
                          field values on individual user objects to display users' profiles.

                          An array of objects; each object describes a type of custom profile field
                          that could be configured on this Zulip server. Each custom profile type
                          has an ID and the `type` property of a custom profile field is equal
                          to one of these IDs.

                          This attribute is only useful for clients containing UI for changing
                          the set of configured custom profile fields in a Zulip organization.

                          steps were not supported, and the `type` field in these objects did not
                          exist as all onboarding steps were implicitly hotspots.

                          to the server (and thus receive presence updates from the server).

                          It is important for presence implementations to use both this and
                          `server_presence_offline_threshold_seconds` correctly, so that a Zulip
                          server can change these values to manage the trade-off between load and
                          freshness of presence data.

                          **Changes**: New in Zulip 7.0 (feature level 164). Clients should use 60
                          for older Zulip servers, since that's the value that was hardcoded in the

                          The first element of the tuple is the channel name in which the topic
                          has to be muted, the second element is the topic name to be muted
                          and the third element is an integer UNIX timestamp representing

                          The order of the array reflects the order that each
                          linkifier should be processed when linkifying messages
                          and topics. By default, new linkifiers are ordered
                          last. This order can be modified with [`PATCH

                          parameter for how this can be specified.

                          **Changes**: Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 176), the
                          `linkifier_url_template` client capability was not required. The
                          requirement was added because linkifiers were updated to contain
                          a URL template instead of a URL format string, which was a not
                          backwards-compatible change.

                          New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 54). Clients can access this data for
                          servers on earlier feature levels via the legacy `realm_filters` property.

                          **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 7.0 (feature level 176), this was
                          an array of tuples, where each tuple described a linkifier. The first
                          element of the tuple was a string regex pattern which represented the
                          pattern to be linkified on matching, for example `"#(?P<id>[123])"`.
                          The second element was a URL format string that the pattern should be
                          linkified with. A URL format string for the above example would be
                          `"https://realm.com/my_realm_filter/%(id)s"`. And the third element
                          was the ID of the realm filter.

                          **Deprecated** in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 54), replaced by the
                          `realm_linkifiers` key.

                                    The `partial_subscribers` list contains an arbitrary
                                    subset of the channel's subscribers that is guaranteed
                                    to include all bot user subscribers as well as all
                                    users who have been active in the last 14 days, but
                                    otherwise can be chosen arbitrarily by the server.

                                    If a user is not allowed to know the subscribers for
                                    a channel, we will send an empty array. API authors
                                    should use other data to determine whether users like
                                    guest users are forbidden to know the subscribers.

                          A array of dictionaries where each dictionary describes one of the
                          channels that is visible to the user and the user has never been subscribed
                          to.

                          Important for clients containing UI where one can browse channels to subscribe
                          to.

                          **Changes**: Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 362), archived channels did
                          not appear in this list, even if the `archived_channels` [client
                          capability][client-capabilities] was declared by the client.

                          Prior to Zulip 10.0 (feature level 349), if a user was
                          in `can_administer_channel_group` of a channel that they never
                          subscribed to, but not an organization administrator, the channel
                          in question would not be part of this array.

                          Only channel folders with one or more public web channels are
                          visible to spectators.

                          the 50000 most recent unread messages the user has received. This will usually
                          contain every unread message the user has received, but clients should support
                          users with even more unread messages (and not hardcode the number 50000).

                              to the specified user to be marked as unread and thus appear here.

                              **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 90), these objects
                              included a `sender_ids` property, which listed the set of IDs of

                          An array of dictionaries where each dictionary contains details
                          about a single default channel group configured for this
                          Zulip organization.

                          An array containing the stop words used by the Zulip server's
                          full-text search implementation. Useful for showing helpful
                          error messages when a search returns limited results because
                          a stop word in the query was ignored.

                          A dictionary which contains the [status](/help/status-and-availability)
                          of all users in the Zulip organization who have set a status.

                          **Changes**: The emoji parameters are new in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 86).
                          Previously, Zulip did not support emoji associated with statuses.

                          A dictionary containing the user's personal settings.

                          **Changes**: Removed duplicate copies of many of these settings from the
                          top-level object in Zulip 12.0 (feature level 439). Previously,
                          clients that did not include `user_settings_object` in their
                          [`client_capabilities`][capabilities] and included
                          `update_display_settings` or `update_global_notifications` in
                          `fetch_event_types` would receive the settings that predated feature level
                          89 in the top-level response.

                          Removed `dense_mode` setting in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 364) as we now
                          have `web_font_size_px` and `web_line_height_percent` settings for more
                          control.

                          New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 89). Previously, these
                          settings appeared in the top-level object, where they are
                          available for clients without the `user_settings_object` client
                          capability for backwards-compatibility.

                              **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 11.0 (feature level 408), `null`
                              was not a valid value for this setting. Note that it was not possible

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 7.0 (feature level 175). Previously, there was no
                              way for the user to configure this behavior on the web, and the Zulip web and
                              desktop apps behaved like the "Always" setting when marking messages as read.

                              The "List of topics" option is new in Zulip 11.0 (feature level 383).

                              New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 269). Previously, this
                              was not configurable, and every user had the "Channel feed" behavior.

                              to users who for whom this is enabled.

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 253). Previously, there were
                              only options to disable sending typing notifications.

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 245). Previously, font size was
                              only adjustable via browser zoom. Note that this setting was not fully
                              implemented at this feature level.

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 245). Previously, line height was
                              not user-configurable. Note that this setting was not fully implemented at this
                              feature level.

                              Whether to display the names of reacting users on a message.

                              When enabled, clients should display the names of reacting
                              users, rather than a count, for messages with few total
                              reactions. The ideal cutoff may depend on the space
                              available for displaying reactions; the official web
                              application displays names when 3 or fewer total reactions
                              are present with this setting enabled.

                              The value needs to be a standard language code that the Zulip server has
                              translation data for; for example, `"en"` for English or `"de"` for German.

                          GIPHY's client-side SDKs needs this API key to use the GIPHY API.
                          GIPHY API keys are not secret (their main purpose appears to be

                          removed in the future, as it is an inaccurate version
                          `realm_message_edit_history_visibility_policy`, which replaces this field.

                          The organization's default policy for sending channel messages to the
                          [empty "general chat" topic](/help/require-topics).

                          - `"allow_empty_topic"`: Channel messages can be sent to the empty topic.
                          - `"disable_empty_topic"`: Channel messages cannot be sent to the empty topic.

                          **Changes**: New in Zulip 11.0 (feature level 392). Previously, this was
                          controlled by the boolean `realm_mandatory_topics` setting, which is now
                          deprecated.

                          - `-1` denoting that the messages will be retained forever for this realm, by default.

                          **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 3.0 (feature level 22), no limit was
                          encoded as `null` instead of `-1`. Clients can correctly handle all
                          server versions by treating both `-1` and `null` as indicating
                          unlimited message retention.

                          Whether this realm is configured to disallow sending mobile
                          push notifications with message content through the legacy
                          mobile push notifications APIs. The new API uses end-to-end
                          encryption to protect message content and metadata from
                          being accessible to the push bouncer service, APNs, and
                          FCM. Clients that support the new E2EE API will use it
                          automatically regardless of this setting.

                          If `true`, mobile push notifications sent to clients that
                          lack support for E2EE push notifications will always have
                          "New message" as their content. Note that these legacy
                          mobile notifications will still contain metadata, which may
                          include the message's ID, the sender's name, email address,
                          and avatar.

                          In a future release, once the official mobile apps have
                          implemented fully validated their E2EE protocol support,
                          this setting will become strict, and disable the legacy
                          protocol entirely.

                          **Changes**: New in Zulip 11.0 (feature level 409). Previously,
                          this behavior was available only via the
                          `PUSH_NOTIFICATION_REDACT_CONTENT` global server setting.

                          doing so would lead to two users whose names are identical modulo
                          case and unicode normalization.

                          **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 246). Previously, the Zulip

                          set for this realm setting. Clients supporting older server versions
                          should treat either value (`null` or `""`) as no default being set.

                          The data at the given URL is a JSON object with one property, `code_to_names`.
                          The value of that property is a JSON object where each key is an
                          [emoji code](/api/add-reaction#parameter-emoji_code) for an available
                          Unicode emoji, and each value is the corresponding

                          with the canonical name for the emoji always appearing first.

                          The HTTP response at that URL will have appropriate HTTP caching headers, such
                          any HTTP implementation should get a cached version if emoji haven't changed
                          since the last request.

                          Recommended client-side HTTP request timeout for [`GET /events`](/api/get-events) calls.
                          This is guaranteed to be somewhat greater than the heartbeat frequency. It is important
                          that clients respect this parameter, so that increases in the heartbeat frequency do not
                          break clients.

                          **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 74). Previously,
                          this was hardcoded to 90 seconds, and clients should use that as a fallback
                          value when interacting with servers where this field is not present.

                          Will be `-1` if moderation requests are disabled.

                          Clients should check whether moderation requests are disabled to
                          determine whether to present a "report message" feature in their UI
                          within a given organization.

                          **Changes**: New in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 331). Previously,
                          no "report message" feature existed in Zulip.

                          **Changes**: In Zulip 9.0 (feature level 241), renamed
                          'realm_signup_notifications_stream_id' to `realm_signup_announcements_stream_id`.
                      realm_zulip_update_announcements_stream_id:
                        type: integer
                        description: |
                          Present if `realm` is present in `fetch_event_types`.

                          The ID of the channel to which automated messages announcing
                          new features or other end-user updates about the Zulip software are sent.

                          Will be `-1` if such automated messages are disabled.

                          Since these automated messages are sent by the server, this field is
                          primarily relevant to clients containing UI for changing it.

                          **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 242).
                      realm_empty_topic_display_name:
                        type: string
                        description: |
                          Present if `realm` is present in `fetch_event_types`.

                          Clients declaring the `empty_topic_name` client capability
                          should use the value of `realm_empty_topic_display_name` to
                          determine how to display the empty string topic.

                          Clients not declaring the `empty_topic_name` client capability
                          receive `realm_empty_topic_display_name` value as the topic name
                          replacing empty string.

                          **Changes**: New in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 334). Previously,
                          the empty string was not a valid topic name.
                      realm_user_settings_defaults:

                          A dictionary containing the default values of settings for new users.

                          **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 95).
                        properties:
                          twenty_four_hour_time:
                            type: boolean
                            nullable: true

                              Whether time should be [displayed in 24-hour notation](/help/change-the-time-format).

                              A `null` value indicates that the client should use the default time
                              format for the user's locale.

                              **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 11.0 (feature level 408), `null`
                              was not a valid value for this setting. Note that it was not possible
                              to actually set the time format to `null` at this feature level.

                              New in Zulip 5.0 (feature level 99). This value was previously
                              available as `realm_default_twenty_four_hour_time` in the top-level
                              response object (only when `realm` was present in
                              `fetch_event_types`).

                              - 1 - Always

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 7.0 (feature level 175). Previously, there was no
                              way for the user to configure this behavior on the web, and the Zulip web and
                              desktop apps behaved like the "Always" setting when marking messages as read.
                          web_channel_default_view:
                            type: integer

                              Web/desktop app setting controlling the default navigation
                              behavior when clicking on a channel link.

                              - 1 - Top topic in the channel
                              - 2 - Channel feed
                              - 3 - List of topics
                              - 4 - Top unread topic in channel

                              **Changes**: The "Top unread topic in channel" is new in Zulip 11.0
                              (feature level 401).

                              In Zulip 11.0 (feature level 383), we added a new option "List of topics"
                              to this setting.

                              New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 269). Previously, this
                              was not configurable, and every user had the "Channel feed" behavior.
                          starred_message_counts:

                              other users. The server will only deliver typing notifications events
                              to users who for whom this is enabled.

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 253). Previously, there were
                              only options to disable sending typing notifications.
                          web_suggest_update_timezone:
                            type: boolean

                              [profile time zone](/help/change-your-timezone), when the time displayed
                              for the profile time zone differs from the current time displayed by the
                              time zone configured on their device.

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 329).

                              User-configured primary `font-size` for the web application, in pixels.

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 245). Previously, font size was
                              only adjustable via browser zoom. Note that this setting was not fully
                              implemented at this feature level.
                            type: integer

                              User-configured primary `line-height` for the web application, in percent, so a
                              value of 120 represents a `line-height` of 1.2.

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 245). Previously, line height was
                              not user-configurable. Note that this setting was not fully implemented at this
                              feature level.
                            type: integer

                              Controls which [color theme](/help/dark-theme) to use.

                              - 1 - Automatic
                              - 2 - Dark theme
                              - 3 - Light theme

                              Automatic detection is implementing using the standard `prefers-color-scheme`
                              media query.

                              Whether to display the names of reacting users on a message.

                              When enabled, clients should display the names of reacting
                              users, rather than a count, for messages with few total
                              reactions. The ideal cutoff may depend on the space
                              available for displaying reactions; the official web
                              application displays names when 3 or fewer total reactions
                              are present with this setting enabled.

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 6.0 (feature level 125).

                              What [default language](/help/change-your-language) to use for the account.

                              This controls both the Zulip UI as well as email notifications sent to the user.

                              The value needs to be a standard language code that the Zulip server has
                              translation data for; for example, `"en"` for English or `"de"` for German.

                              **Changes**: New in Zulip 8.0 (feature level 219). Previously, this was
                              called `default_view`, which was new in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 42).

                          Present if `realm_user` is present in `fetch_event_types`.

                          A array of dictionaries where each entry describes a user
                          whose account has not been deactivated. Note that unlike
                          the usual User dictionary, this does not contain the `is_active`
                          key, as all the users present in this array have active accounts.

                          If the current user is a guest whose access to users is limited by a
                          `can_access_all_users_group` policy, and the event queue was registered
                          with the `user_list_incomplete` client capability, then users that the
                          current user cannot access will not be included in this array. If the
                          current user's access to a user is restricted but the client lacks this
                          capability, then that inaccessible user will appear in the users array as
                          an "Unknown user" object with the usual format but placeholder data whose
                          only variable content is the user ID.

                          `user_list_incomplete` client capability did not exist, and so all
                          clients whose access to a new user was prevented by
                          `can_access_all_users_group` policy would receive a fake "Unknown
                          user" event for such users.

                          a single cross realm bot. Cross-realm bots are special system bot accounts
                          like Notification Bot.

                          Most clients will want to combine this with `realm_users` in many
                          contexts.

        Please note that not all of these attributes are guaranteed to appear in a
        response, for two reasons:

        * This endpoint has evolved over time, so responses from older Zulip servers
          might be missing some keys (in which case a client should assume the
          appropriate default).
        * If a `/server_settings` request is made to the root domain of a
          multi-subdomain server, like the root domain of zulip.com, the settings
          that are realm-specific are not known and thus not provided.

        Fetch global settings for a Zulip server.

        **Note:** this endpoint does not require any authentication at all, and you can use it to check:

        - If this is a Zulip server, and if so, what version of Zulip it's running.
        - What a Zulip client (e.g. a mobile app or
          [zulip-terminal](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal/)) needs to
          know in order to display a login prompt for the server (e.g. what
          authentication methods are available).

                          The list is sorted in the order in which these
                          authentication methods should be displayed.

                          a value of N means the server supports all API features introduced
                          before feature level N. This is designed to provide a simple way
                          for client apps to decide whether the server supports a given
                          feature or API change. See the [changelog](/api/changelog) for
                          details on what each feature level means.

        This endpoint is used to edit the current user's settings.

        **Changes**: Removed `dense_mode` setting in Zulip 10.0
        (feature level 364) as we now have `web_font_size_px` and
        `web_line_height_percent` settings for more control.

        Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 80), this endpoint only
        supported the `full_name`, `email`, `old_password`, and
        `new_password` parameters. Notification settings were
        managed by `PATCH /settings/notifications`, and all other
        settings by `PATCH /settings/display`.

        The feature level 80 migration to merge these endpoints did not
        change how request parameters are encoded. However, it did change
        the handling of any invalid parameters present in a request
        (see feature level 78 change below).

        As of feature level 80, the `PATCH /settings/display` and
        `PATCH /settings/notifications` endpoints are deprecated aliases
        for this endpoint for backwards-compatibility, and will be removed
        once clients have migrated to use this endpoint.

        Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 78), this endpoint indicated
        which parameters it had processed by including in the response
        object `"key": value` entries for values successfully changed by
        the request. That was replaced by the more ergonomic
        [`ignored_parameters_unsupported`][ignored-parameters] array.

        The `PATCH /settings/notifications` and `PATCH /settings/display`
        endpoints also had this behavior of indicating processed parameters
        before they became aliases of this endpoint in Zulip 5.0 (see
        feature level 80 change above).

        Before feature level 78, request parameters that were not supported
        (or were unchanged) were silently ignored.

                    When enabled, clients should display the names of reacting users, rather than
                    a count, for messages with few total reactions. The ideal cutoff may depend on
                    the space available for displaying reactions; the official web application
                    displays names when 3 or fewer total reactions are present with this setting

                                    The average number of messages sent to the channel per week, as
                                    estimated based on recent weeks, rounded to the nearest integer.

                                    If `null`, no information is provided on the average traffic.
                                    This can be because the channel was recently created and there
                                    is insufficient data to make an estimate, or because the server
                                    wishes to omit this information for this client, this realm, or
                                    this endpoint or type of event.

        Configure the channel with the ID `stream_id`. This endpoint supports
        an organization administrator editing any property of a channel,

        - Channel [name](/help/rename-a-channel) and [description](/help/change-the-channel-description)
        - Channel [permissions](/help/channel-permissions), including
          [privacy](/help/change-the-privacy-of-a-channel) and [who can

        Note that an organization administrator's ability to change a
        [private channel's permissions](/help/channel-permissions#private-channels)
        depends on them being subscribed to the channel.

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 362), channel privacy could not be
        edited for archived channels.

        Removed `stream_post_policy` and `is_announcement_only`
        parameters in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 333), as permission to post
        in the channel is now controlled by `can_send_message_group`.

                    It's an error for this parameter to be false for a public or

                    This can only be `false` if `can_create_topic_group` for the channel
                    is the `role:everyone` [system group][system-groups].

                        could not unsubscribe other users if they were not an organization
                        administrator or part of `can_remove_subscribers_group`. Realm administrators
                        were not allowed to unsubscribe other users from a private channel if they
                        were not subscribed to that channel.

                        Everyone, excluding guests, can subscribe to any public channel
                        irrespective of this setting.

                        Users in this group can subscribe to a private channel as well.

                        Note that a user must [have content access](/help/channel-permissions)
                        to a channel and permission to administer the channel in order to
                        modify this setting.

      operationId: delete-topic
      summary: Delete a topic
      tags: ["channels"]
      description: |
        Delete all messages in a topic.

        Topics are a field on messages (not an independent data structure), so
        deleting all the messages in the topic deletes the topic from Zulip.

        Because this endpoint deletes messages in batches, it is possible for
        the request to time out after only deleting some messages in the topic.
        When this happens, the `complete` boolean field in the success response
        will be `false`. Clients should repeat the request when handling such a
        response. If all messages in the topic were deleted, then the success
        response will return `"complete": true`.

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 9.0 (feature level 256), the server never sent
        [`stream` op: `update`](/api/get-events#stream-update) events with an
        updated `first_message_id` for a channel when the oldest message that
        had been sent to it changed.

        Before Zulip 8.0 (feature level 211), if the server's
        processing was interrupted by a timeout, but some messages in the topic
        were deleted, then it would return `"result": "partially_completed"`,
        along with a `code` field for an error string, in the success response
        to indicate that there was a timeout and that the client should repeat
        the request.

        As of Zulip 6.0 (feature level 154), instead of returning an error
        response when a request times out after successfully deleting some of
        the messages in the topic, a success response is returned with
        `"result": "partially_completed"` to indicate that some messages were
        deleted.

        Before Zulip 6.0 (feature level 147), this request did a single atomic
        operation, which could time out for very large topics. As of this
        feature level, messages are deleted in batches, starting with the newest
        messages, so that progress is made even if the request times out and
        returns an error.

        Notify other users whether the current user is
        [typing a message][help-typing].

        Clients implementing Zulip's typing notifications
        protocol should work as follows:

        - Send a request to this endpoint with `"op": "start"` when a user
          starts composing a message.
        - While the user continues to actively type or otherwise interact with
          the compose UI (e.g. interacting with the compose box emoji picker),
          send regular `"op": "start"` requests to this endpoint, using
          `server_typing_started_wait_period_milliseconds` in the
          [`POST /register`][api-register] response as the time interval
          between each request.
        - Send a request to this endpoint with `"op": "stop"` when a user
          has stopped using the compose UI for the time period indicated by
          `server_typing_stopped_wait_period_milliseconds` in the
          [`POST /register`][api-register] response or when a user
          cancels the compose action (if it had previously sent a "start"
          notification for that compose action).
        - Start displaying a visual typing indicator for a given conversation
          when a [`typing op:start`][start-typing] event is received
          from the server.
        - Continue displaying a visual typing indicator for the conversation
          until a [`typing op:stop`][stop-typing] event is received
          from the server or the time period indicated by
          `server_typing_started_expiry_period_milliseconds` in the
          [`POST /register`][api-register] response has passed without
          a new `typing "op": "start"` event for the conversation.

        This protocol is designed to allow the server-side typing notifications
        implementation to be stateless while being resilient as network failures
        will not result in a user being incorrectly displayed as perpetually
        typing.

        See the subsystems documentation on [typing indicators][typing-protocol-docs]
        for additional design details on Zulip's typing notifications protocol.

        **Changes**: Clients shouldn't care about the APIs prior to Zulip 8.0 (feature level 215)
        for channel typing notifications, as no client actually implemented
        the previous API for those.

        Support for displaying channel typing notifications was new
        in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58). Clients should indicate they support
        processing channel typing notifications via the `stream_typing_notifications`
        value in the `client_capabilities` parameter of the
        [`POST /register`][client-capabilities] endpoint.

                    Type of the message being composed.

                    **Changes**: In Zulip 9.0 (feature level 248), `"channel"` was added as
                    an additional value for this parameter to indicate a channel message is
                    being composed.

                    In Zulip 8.0 (feature level 215), stopped supporting
                    `"private"` as a valid value for this parameter.

                    In Zulip 7.0 (feature level 174), `"direct"` was added
                    as the preferred way to indicate a direct message is being composed,
                    becoming the default value for this parameter and deprecating the
                    original `"private"`.

                    New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58). Previously, typing notifications
                    were only for direct messages.
                  type: string
                  enum:

                    `"direct"` type. Ignored in the case of `"stream"` or `"channel"` type.

                    Clients should send a JSON-encoded list of user IDs, even if there is only
                    one recipient.

                    **Changes**: In Zulip 8.0 (feature level 215), stopped using this parameter
                    for the `"stream"` type. Previously, in the case of the `"stream"` type, it
                    accepted a single-element list containing the ID of the channel. A new parameter,
                    `stream_id`, is now used for this. Note that the `"channel"` type did not
                    exist at this feature level.

                    Support for typing notifications for channel' messages
                    is new in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 58). Previously, typing
                    notifications were only for direct messages.

                    Before Zulip 2.0.0, this parameter accepted only a JSON-encoded
                    list of email addresses. Support for the email address-based format was
                    removed in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 11).

                    ID of the channel in which the message is being typed. Required for the `"stream"`
                    or `"channel"` type. Ignored in the case of `"direct"` type.

                    **Changes**: New in Zulip 8.0 (feature level 215). Previously, a single-element
                    list containing the ID of the channel was passed in `to` parameter.

                    type. Ignored in the case of `"direct"` type.

                    Note: When `"(no topic)"` or the value of `realm_empty_topic_display_name`
                    found in the [POST /register](/api/register-queue) response is used for this
                    parameter, it is interpreted as an empty string.

                    **Changes**: Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 372),
                    `"(no topic)"` was not interpreted as an empty string.

                    Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 334), empty string
                    was not a valid topic name for channel messages.

        Deactivate a user group. Deactivated user groups cannot be
        used for mentions, permissions, or any other purpose, but can
        be reactivated or renamed.

        Deactivating user groups is preferable to deleting them from
        the database, since the deactivation model allows audit logs
        of changes to sensitive group-valued permissions to be
        maintained.

          description: |
            A boolean indicating whether the channel is [archived](/help/archive-a-channel).

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 315).
            Previously, this endpoint never returned archived channels.
        description:
          type: string
          description: |
            The short description of the channel in [Zulip-flavored Markdown](/help/format-your-message-using-markdown) format,
            intended to be used to prepopulate UI for editing a channel's
            description.

            See [Markdown message formatting](/api/message-formatting) for details on Zulip's HTML format.
        date_created:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The UNIX timestamp for when the channel was created, in UTC seconds.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 4.0 (feature level 30).
        creator_id:
          type: integer
          nullable: true
          description: |
            The ID of the user who created this channel.

            A `null` value means the channel has no recorded creator, which is often
            because the channel is very old, was created during realm creation or
            because it was created via a data import tool or [management command][management-commands].

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 9.0 (feature level 254).

        rendered_description:
          type: string
          description: |
            The short description of the channel rendered as HTML, intended to
            be used when displaying the channel description in a UI.

            One should use the standard Zulip rendered_markdown CSS when
            displaying this content so that emoji, LaTeX, and other syntax
            work correctly. And any client-side security logic for
            user-generated message content should be applied when displaying
            this HTML as though it were the body of a Zulip message.
        is_web_public:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            Whether the channel has been configured to allow unauthenticated
            access to its message history from the web.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 2.1.0.
        stream_post_policy:
          type: integer
          deprecated: true
          description: |
            A deprecated representation of a superset of the users who
            have permission to post messages to the channel available
            for backwards-compatibility. Clients should use
            `can_send_message_group` instead.

            It is an enum with the following possible values, corresponding
            to roles/system groups:

            - 1 = Any user can post.
            - 2 = Only administrators can post.
            - 3 = Only [full members][calc-full-member] can post.
            - 4 = Only moderators can post.

            **Changes**: Deprecated in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 333) and
            replaced by `can_send_message_group`, which supports finer
            resolution of configurations, resulting in this property being
            inaccurate following that transition.

            New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1), replacing the previous
            `is_announcement_only` boolean.

          description: |
            Number of days that messages sent to this channel will be stored
            before being automatically deleted by the [message retention
            policy](/help/message-retention-policy). There are two special values:

            - `null`, the default, means the channel will inherit the organization
              level setting.
            - `-1` encodes retaining messages in this channel forever.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 17).
        history_public_to_subscribers:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            Whether the history of the channel is public to its subscribers.

            Currently always true for public channels (i.e. `"invite_only": false` implies
            `"history_public_to_subscribers": true`), but clients should not make that
            assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.

          nullable: true
          description: |
            The ID of the first message in the channel.

            Intended to help clients determine whether they need to display
            UI like the "show all topics" widget that would suggest the channel
            has older history that can be accessed.

            Is `null` for channels with no message history.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 2.1.0.
        folder_id:

        is_recently_active:
          type: boolean
          description: |
            Whether the channel has recent message activity. Clients should use this to implement
            [hide inactive channels](/help/manage-inactive-channels) if
            `demote_inactive_streams` is enabled.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 323). Previously, clients implemented the
            demote_inactive_streams from local message history, resulting in a choppy loading
            experience.
        is_announcement_only:
          type: boolean
          deprecated: true
          description: |
            Whether the given channel is announcement only or not.

            **Changes**: Deprecated in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1). Clients
            should use `stream_post_policy` instead.

        subscriber_count:
          type: number
          description: |
            The total number of non-deactivated users (including bots) who
            are subscribed to the channel. Clients are responsible for updating
            this value using `peer_add` and `peer_remove` events.

            The server's internals cannot guarantee this value is correctly
            synced with `peer_add` and `peer_remove` events for the channel. As
            a result, if a (rare) race occurs between a change in the channel's
            subscribers and fetching this value, it is possible for a client
            that is correctly following the events protocol to end up with a
            permanently off-by-one error in the channel's subscriber count.

            Clients are recommended to fetch full subscriber data for a channel
            in contexts where it is important to avoid this risk. The official
            web application, for example, uses this field primarily while
            waiting to fetch a given channel's full subscriber list from the
            server.

            For field type 3 (List of options), this attribute is a JSON dictionary
            defining the choices and the order they will be displayed in the
            dropdown UI for individual users to select an option.

            Because the required property is mutable, clients cannot assume that a required
            custom profile field has a value. The Zulip web application displays a prominent
            banner to any user who has not set a value for a required field.

            The path relative to the organization's URL where a still
            (not animated) version of the emoji can be found. (This is
            currently always the first frame of the animation).

            This is useful for clients to display the emoji in contexts
            where continuously animating it would be a bad user experience
            (E.g. because it would be distracting).

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 5.0 (added as optional field in
            feature level 97 and then made mandatory, but nullable, in
            feature level 113).

            exactly one variable named `code`, which determines how the
            extracted code should be substituted in the playground URL.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 8.0 (feature level 196). This replaced the

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 304). Previously,
            the export type was not included in these objects because only

            Note that email invitations and reusable invitation links are stored
            in different database tables on the server, so each ID is guaranteed
            to be unique in combination with the boolean value of `is_multiuse`,
            e.g. there can only be one invitation with `id: 1` and `is_multiuse:

    InviteExpirationParameter:
      description: |
        The number of minutes before the invitation will expire. If `null`, the
        invitation will never expire. If unspecified, the server will use a default
        value (based on the `INVITATION_LINK_VALIDITY_MINUTES` server setting, which
        defaults to 14400, i.e. 10 days) for when the invitation will expire.

        **Changes**: New in Zulip 6.0 (feature level 126). Previously, there was an
        `invite_expires_in_days` parameter, which specified the duration in days instead
        of minutes.
      type: integer

    InviteRoleParameter:
      description: |
        The [organization-level role](/api/roles-and-permissions) of the user that is

        Possible values are:

        - 300 = Organization moderator
        - 400 = Member

        Users can only create invitation links for
        [roles with equal or stricter restrictions](/api/roles-and-permissions#permission-levels)
        as their own. For example, a moderator cannot invite someone to be an owner
        or administrator, but they can invite them to be a moderator or member.

        **Changes**: In Zulip 4.0 (feature level 61), added support for inviting
        users as moderators.

            displaying this content so that emoji, LaTeX, and other syntax
            work correctly. And any client-side security logic for
            user-generated message content should be applied when displaying

            A `null` value means the channel has no recorded creator, which is often
            because the channel is very old, was created during realm creation or
            because it was created via a data import tool or [management command][management-commands].

            for channels with a large number of subscribers.

            The `partial_subscribers` list contains an arbitrary
            subset of the channel's subscribers that is guaranteed
            to include all bot user subscribers as well as all

            **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 2.1.0, this feature was

          description: |
            A deprecated representation of a superset of the users who
            have permission to post messages to the channel available
            for backwards-compatibility. Clients should use
            `can_send_message_group` instead.

            It is an enum with the following possible values, corresponding
            to roles/system groups:

            - 1 = Any user can post.
            - 2 = Only administrators can post.
            - 3 = Only [full members][calc-full-member] can post.
            - 4 = Only moderators can post.

            **Changes**: Deprecated in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 333) and
            replaced by `can_send_message_group`, which supports finer
            resolution of configurations, resulting in this property being
            inaccurate following that transition.

            New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1), replacing the previous
            `is_announcement_only` boolean.

            - `null`, the default, means the channel will inherit the organization
              level setting.
            - `-1` encodes retaining messages in this channel forever.

          type: boolean
          description: |
            Whether the history of the channel is public to its subscribers.

            Currently always true for public channels (i.e. `"invite_only": false` implies
            `"history_public_to_subscribers": true`), but clients should not make that
            assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.

            Intended to help clients determine whether they need to display
            UI like the "show all topics" widget that would suggest the channel
            has older history that can be accessed.

            Whether the channel has recent message activity. Clients should use this to implement
            [hiding inactive channels](/help/manage-inactive-channels).

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 323). Previously, clients implemented the
            demote_inactive_streams from local message history, resulting in a choppy loading
            experience.

            A boolean indicating whether the channel is [archived](/help/archive-a-channel).

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 315).
            Previously, subscriptions only included active
            channels. Note that some endpoints will never return archived
            channels unless the client declares explicit support for
            them via the `archived_channels` client capability.
        subscriber_count:
          type: number
          description: |
            The total number of non-deactivated users (including bots) who
            are subscribed to the channel. Clients are responsible for updating
            this value using `peer_add` and `peer_remove` events.

            The server's internals cannot guarantee this value is correctly
            synced with `peer_add` and `peer_remove` events for the channel. As
            a result, if a (rare) race occurs between a change in the channel's
            subscribers and fetching this value, it is possible for a client
            that is correctly following the events protocol to end up with a
            permanently off-by-one error in the channel's subscriber count.

            Clients are recommended to fetch full subscriber data for a channel
            in contexts where it is important to avoid this risk. The official
            web application, for example, uses this field primarily while
            waiting to fetch a given channel's full subscriber list from the
            server.

                In Zulip 10.0 (feature level 328), the deprecated `user` object
                was removed which contained the following properties: `id`, `email`,
                `full_name` and `is_mirror_dummy`.

            - `unicode_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be a
              dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
              that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

            - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
              the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

            - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Zulip.
              In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.
              "zulip").

                **Changes**: This field was re-added in Zulip 10.0 (feature
                level 339) after having been removed in Zulip 10.0 (feature
                level 328). It remains deprecated; it was re-added because the
                React Native mobile app was still using it.

                **Deprecated** and to be removed in a future release once core
                clients have migrated to use the adjacent `user_id` field, which
                was introduced in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 2). Clients
                supporting older Zulip server versions should use the user ID

            If `null`, then the sender has not uploaded an avatar in Zulip,
            and the client can compute the gravatar URL by hashing the
            sender's email address, which corresponds in this case to their
            real email address.

            **Changes**: Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 163), access to a
            user's real email address was a realm-level setting. As of this
            feature level, `email_address_visibility` is a user setting.

            Clients should use this field, rather than parsing the `edit_history`

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 10.0 (feature level 365). Previously,

            **Changes**: Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 327), `recipient_id`
            was the same across all incoming 1:1 direct messages. Now, each

            though this could change if Zulip adds support for topics in direct
            message conversations.

            The field name is a legacy holdover from when topics were
            called "subjects" and will eventually change.

            For clients that don't support the `empty_topic_name` [client capability][client-capabilities],
            the empty string value is replaced with the value of `realm_empty_topic_display_name`
            found in the [POST /register](/api/register-queue) response, for channel messages.

            **Changes**: Before Zulip 10.0 (feature level 334), `empty_topic_name`
            client capability didn't exist and empty string as the topic name for
            channel messages wasn't allowed.

            New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1). Previously, this field was called
            `subject_links`; clients are recommended to rename `subject_links` to `topic_links`

            The UNIX timestamp of the last time a client connected
            to Zulip reported that the user was actually present
            (e.g. via focusing a browser window or interacting
            with a computer running the desktop app).

            Clients should display users with a current
            `active_timestamp` as fully present.
        idle_timestamp:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The UNIX timestamp of the last time the user had a
            client connected to Zulip, including idle clients
            where the user hasn't interacted with the system
            recently.

            The Zulip server has no way of distinguishing whether
            an idle web app user is at their computer, but hasn't
            interacted with the Zulip tab recently, or simply left
            their desktop computer on when they left.

            Thus, clients should display users with a current
            `idle_timestamp` but no current `active_timestamp` as
            potentially present.

        contain two keys, `"website"` and `"aggregated"`, with identical data. The
        server no longer stores which client submitted presence updates.

        Previously, the `{client_name}` keys for these objects were the names of the

            the [group-setting value](/api/group-setting-values) for this setting.

          type: string
          description: |
            Name of the default system group for the setting.

            For some channel settings, this can also be `channel_creator`.
            In that case:

            - If the channel's [`creator_id`][channel-response] is not `null`, default for the
              setting is an anonymous group with the channel creator as
              the only member.
            - If the channel's [`creator_id`][channel-response] is `null`, default for the setting
              is `role:nobody` system group.

            **Changes**: In Zulip 12.0 (feature level 427), renamed
            `stream_creator_or_nobody` value to `channel_creator`.

            set to the real email of the bot, because bot users always have
            `email_address_visibility` set to everyone.

            **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 7.0 (feature level 163), this field was
            present only when `email_address_visibility` was restricted and you had
            access to the user's real email. As of this feature level, this field

            is the user ID of the bot's owner (usually, whoever created the bot).

            Will be `null` for legacy bots that do not have an owner.

            **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1). In previous
            versions, there was a `bot_owner` field containing the email

          nullable: true
          description: |
            URL for the user's avatar.

            Will be `null` if the `client_gravatar`
            query parameter was set to `true`, the current user has access to
            this user's real email address, and this user's avatar is hosted by
            the Gravatar provider (i.e. this user has never uploaded an avatar).

            **Changes**: Before Zulip 7.0 (feature level 163), access to a
            user's real email address was a realm-level setting. As of this
            feature level, `email_address_visibility` is a user setting.

            In Zulip 3.0 (feature level 18), if the client has the
            `user_avatar_url_field_optional` capability, this will be missing at
            the server's sole discretion.
        avatar_version:

          description: |
            Version for the user's avatar. Used for cache-busting requests
            for the user's avatar. Clients generally shouldn't need to use this;
            most avatar URLs sent by Zulip will already end with `?v={avatar_version}`.

            accounts when the user starts using Zulip, preserving that imported
            user's message history.

        array was added as a possible return value for all REST API endpoint
        JSON success responses in Zulip 7.0 (feature level 167).

        Previously, it was added to

        (feature level 78) as a return value for the
        [`PATCH /settings`](/api/update-settings) endpoint.

    Event_types:
      description: |
        A JSON-encoded array indicating which types of events you're interested
        in. Values that you might find useful include:

        - **message** (messages)
        - **subscription** (changes in your subscriptions)
        - **realm_user** (changes to users in the organization and
          their properties, such as their name).

        If you do not specify this parameter, you will receive all
        events, and have to filter out the events not relevant to
        your client in your client code. For most applications, one
        is only interested in messages, so one specifies:
        `"event_types": ["message"]`

        Event types not supported by the server are ignored, in order to simplify
        the implementation of client apps that support multiple server versions.
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
      example: ["message"]
    Narrow:
      description: |
        A JSON-encoded array of arrays of length 2 indicating the
        [narrow filter(s)](/api/construct-narrow) for which you'd
        like to receive events for.

        For example, to receive events for direct messages (including
        group direct messages) received by the user, one can use
        `"narrow": [["is", "dm"]]`.

        Unlike the API for [fetching messages](/api/get-messages),
        this narrow parameter is simply a filter on messages that the
        user receives through their channel subscriptions (or because
        they are a recipient of a direct message).

        This means that a client that requests a `narrow` filter of
        `[["channel", "Denmark"]]` will receive events for new messages
        sent to that channel while the user is subscribed to that
        channel. The client will not receive any message events at all
        if the user is not subscribed to `"Denmark"`.

        Newly created bot users are not usually subscribed to any
        channels, so bots using this API need to be
        [subscribed](/api/subscribe) to any channels whose messages
        you'd like them to process using this endpoint.

        See the `all_public_streams` parameter for how to process all
        public channel messages in an organization.

        **Changes**: See [changes section](/api/construct-narrow#changes)
        of search/narrow filter documentation.

    RequiredContent:
      description: |
        The content of the message.

        Clients should use the `max_message_length` returned by the
        [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) endpoint to determine
        the maximum message size.
      type: string
      example: Hello

        The updated content of the target message.

        Clients should use the `max_message_length` returned by the
        [`POST /register`](/api/register-queue) endpoint to determine
        the maximum message size.

        Note that a message's content and channel cannot be changed at the
        same time, so sending both `content` and `stream_id` parameters will
        throw an error.
      type: string
      example: Hello

      description: |

    ReactionType:
      description: |
        A string indicating the type of emoji. Each emoji `reaction_type`
        has an independent namespace for values of `emoji_code`.

        If an API client is adding/removing a vote on an existing reaction,
        it should pass this parameter using the value the server provided
        for the existing reaction for specificity. Supported values:

        - `unicode_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be a
          dash-separated hex encoding of the sequence of Unicode codepoints
          that define this emoji in the Unicode specification.

        - `realm_emoji` : In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the ID of
          the uploaded [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji).

        - `zulip_extra_emoji` : These are special emoji included with Zulip.
          In this namespace, `emoji_code` will be the name of the emoji (e.g.
          "zulip").

        **Changes**: In Zulip 3.0 (feature level 2), this parameter became
        optional for [custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji);
        previously, this endpoint assumed `unicode_emoji` if this
        parameter was not specified.
      type: string
      example: "unicode_emoji"
    EmojiCode:
      description: |
        A unique identifier, defining the specific emoji codepoint requested,
        within the namespace of the `reaction_type`.

        For most API clients, you won't need this, but it's important
        for Zulip apps to handle rare corner cases when
        adding/removing votes on an emoji reaction added previously by
        another user.

        If the existing reaction was added when the Zulip server was
        using a previous version of the emoji data mapping between
        Unicode codepoints and human-readable names, sending the
        `emoji_code` in the data for the original reaction allows the
        Zulip server to correctly interpret your upvote as an upvote
        rather than a reaction with a "different" emoji.

        Number of days that messages sent to this channel will be stored

        values are supported:

        - `"realm_default"`: Return to the organization-level setting.
        - `"unlimited"`: Retain messages forever.

        **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 5.0 (feature level 91), retaining
        messages forever was encoded using `"forever"` instead of
        `"unlimited"`.

        - `"inherit"`: Messages can be sent to named topics in this channel,
          and the [organization-level `realm_topics_policy`][realm-topics-policy]
          is used for whether messages can be sent to the empty topic in this
          channel.
        - `"allow_empty_topic"`: Messages can be sent to both named topics and
          the empty topic in this channel.
        - `"disable_empty_topic"`: Messages can be sent to named topics in this
          channel, but the empty topic is disabled.

          channel, but named topics are disabled. See ["general chat"
          channels](/help/general-chat-channels).

        The `"empty_topic_only"` policy can only be set if all existing messages
        in the channel are already in the empty topic.

        When creating a new channel, if the `topics_policy` is not specified, the
        `"inherit"` option will be set.

        **Changes**: In Zulip 11.0 (feature level 404), the `"empty_topic_only"`

        No direct messages are sent for any channels that are created as part of
        this request, regardless of the value of this parameter.

        The server will never send direct messages when the total number of users
        who were subscribed to channels in this request was more than the value
        of `max_bulk_new_subscription_messages`, which is available in the [`POST
        /register`](/api/register-queue) response.

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 11.0 (feature level 397), new subscribers
        were always sent a Notification Bot direct message, which was unduly
        expensive when bulk-subscribing thousands of users to a channel.

        **Changes**: Before Zulip 8.0 (feature level 188), bot users could not
        be muted/unmuted, and specifying a bot user's ID returned an error response.

    IncludeSubscribers:
      name: include_subscribers
      in: query
      description: |
        Whether each returned channel object should include a `subscribers`
        field containing a list of the user IDs of its subscribers.

        Client apps supporting organizations with many thousands of users
        should not pass `true`, because the full subscriber matrix may be
        several megabytes of data. The `partial` value, combined with the
        `subscriber_count` and fetching subscribers for individual channels as
        needed, is recommended to support client app features where
        channel subscriber data is useful.

        If a client passes `partial` for this parameter, the server may,
        for some channels, return a subset of the channel's subscribers
        in the `partial_subscribers` field instead of the `subscribers` field,
        which always contains the complete set of subscribers.

        The server guarantees that it will always return a `subscribers`
        field for channels with fewer than 250 total subscribers. When
        returning a `partial_subscribers` field, the server guarantees
        that all bot users and users active within the last 14 days will
        be included. For other cases, the server may use its discretion
        to determine which channels and users to include, balancing between
        payload size and usefulness of the data provided to the client.

        **Changes**: The `partial` value is new in Zulip 11.0 (feature level 412).

        New in Zulip 2.1.0.
