Render JSON payloads nicely in a Zulip code block! This is
particularly useful when you want to capture a webhook payload as part
of [writing an incoming webhook
integration](/api/incoming-webhooks-overview).

1. {!create-stream.md!}

1. {!create-bot-construct-url.md!}

1. Configure your application to send the webhook
    payload to the **URL** generated above.

{!congrats.md!}
