# Humbug's post-receive hook.  There is a symlink
#   from /srv/git/humbug.git/hooks/post-receive
#   to   ~humbug/humbug/tools/post-receive
# on git.humbughq.com.  So to deploy changes to this script, run
#
#   ssh humbug@git.humbughq.com 'cd humbug; git pull'
#
# To send the Humbug notices, this script calls out to our
# for-distribution git hook (under api/integrations/); since the git
# hook needs to be in the same directory as the configuration script
# for the git hook, this means that we need to have a shared directory
# containing (a symlink to) both the the for-distribution git hook and
# the Humbug configuration; for the moment those are
# bots/githook-post-receive and bots/humbug_git_config.py,
# respectively.  We need the intermediate symlink because the git hook
# looks for its configuration in the directory that it sits in, and
# api/integrations/git/ has the example configuration.
#
#
# The "post-receive" script is run after receive-pack has accepted a pack
# and the repository has been updated.  It is passed arguments in through
# stdin in the form
#  <oldrev> <newrev> <refname>
# For example:
#  aa453216d1b3e49e7f6f98441fa56946ddcd6a20 68f7abf4e6f922807889f52bc043ecd31b79f814 refs/heads/master
#
# see contrib/hooks/ for a sample
