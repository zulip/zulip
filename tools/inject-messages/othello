ACT I
SCENE I. Venice. A street.

    [[Enter RODERIGO and IAGO]] 

RODERIGO

    Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly
    That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
    As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.

IAGO

    'Sblood, but you will not hear me:
    If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.

RODERIGO

    Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.

IAGO

    Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
    In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
    Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,
    I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:
    But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,
    Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
    Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
    And, in conclusion,
    Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
    'I have already chose my officer.'
    And what was he?
    Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
    One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
    A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
    That never set a squadron in the field,
    Nor the division of a battle knows
    More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
    Wherein the toged consuls can propose
    As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,
    Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:
    And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
    At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
    Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd
    By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
    He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
    And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.

RODERIGO

    By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.

IAGO

    Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,
    Preferment goes by letter and affection,
    And not by old gradation, where each second
    Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,
    Whether I in any just term am affined
    To love the Moor.

RODERIGO

    I would not follow him then.

IAGO

    O, sir, content you;
    I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
    We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
    Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
    Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
    That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
    Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
    For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:
    Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
    Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
    Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
    And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
    Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
    their coats
    Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
    And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
    It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
    Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
    In following him, I follow but myself;
    Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
    But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
    For when my outward action doth demonstrate
    The native act and figure of my heart
    In compliment extern, 'tis not long after
    But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
    For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.

RODERIGO

    What a full fortune does the thicklips owe
    If he can carry't thus!

IAGO

    Call up her father,
    Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,
    Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,
    And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
    Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
    Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,
    As it may lose some colour.

RODERIGO

    Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.

IAGO

    Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
    As when, by night and negligence, the fire
    Is spied in populous cities.

RODERIGO

    What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!

IAGO

    Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!
    Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!
    Thieves! thieves!

    [[BRABANTIO appears above, at a window]]

BRABANTIO

    What is the reason of this terrible summons?
    What is the matter there?

RODERIGO

    Signior, is all your family within?

IAGO

    Are your doors lock'd?

BRABANTIO

    Why, wherefore ask you this?

IAGO

    'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on
    your gown;
    Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;
    Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
    Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;
    Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
    Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
    Arise, I say.

BRABANTIO

    What, have you lost your wits?

RODERIGO

    Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?

BRABANTIO

    Not I what are you?

RODERIGO

    My name is Roderigo.

BRABANTIO

    The worser welcome:
    I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
    In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
    My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
    Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
    Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
    To start my quiet.

RODERIGO

    Sir, sir, sir,--

BRABANTIO

    But thou must needs be sure
    My spirit and my place have in them power
    To make this bitter to thee.

RODERIGO

    Patience, good sir.

BRABANTIO

    What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;
    My house is not a grange.

RODERIGO

    Most grave Brabantio,
    In simple and pure soul I come to you.

IAGO

    'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not
    serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to
    do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll
    have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;
    you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have
    coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.

BRABANTIO

    What profane wretch art thou?

IAGO

    I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter
    and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.

BRABANTIO

    Thou art a villain.

IAGO

    You are--a senator.

BRABANTIO

    This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.

RODERIGO

    Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,
    If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,
    As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,
    At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,
    Transported, with no worse nor better guard
    But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
    To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--
    If this be known to you and your allowance,
    We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
    But if you know not this, my manners tell me
    We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
    That, from the sense of all civility,
    I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
    Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
    I say again, hath made a gross revolt;
    Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes
    In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
    Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
    If she be in her chamber or your house,
    Let loose on me the justice of the state
    For thus deluding you.

BRABANTIO

    Strike on the tinder, ho!
    Give me a taper! call up all my people!
    This accident is not unlike my dream:
    Belief of it oppresses me already.
    Light, I say! light!

    [[Exit above]]

IAGO

    Farewell; for I must leave you:
    It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
    To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--
    Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,
    However this may gall him with some cheque,
    Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
    With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
    Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,
    Another of his fathom they have none,
    To lead their business: in which regard,
    Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.
    Yet, for necessity of present life,
    I must show out a flag and sign of love,
    Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
    Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
    And there will I be with him. So, farewell.

    [[Exit]]

    [[Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches]]

BRABANTIO

    It is too true an evil: gone she is;
    And what's to come of my despised time
    Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
    Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
    With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!
    How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me
    Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:
    Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?

RODERIGO

    Truly, I think they are.

BRABANTIO

    O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
    Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
    By what you see them act. Is there not charms
    By which the property of youth and maidhood
    May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
    Of some such thing?

RODERIGO

    Yes, sir, I have indeed.

BRABANTIO

    Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
    Some one way, some another. Do you know
    Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?

RODERIGO

    I think I can discover him, if you please,
    To get good guard and go along with me.

BRABANTIO

    Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
    I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
    And raise some special officers of night.
    On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.

    [[Exeunt]]

SCENE II. Another street.

    [[Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches]] 

IAGO

    Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
    Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience
    To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity
    Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times
    I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.

OTHELLO

    'Tis better as it is.

IAGO

    Nay, but he prated,
    And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
    Against your honour
    That, with the little godliness I have,
    I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,
    Are you fast married? Be assured of this,
    That the magnifico is much beloved,
    And hath in his effect a voice potential
    As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;
    Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
    The law, with all his might to enforce it on,
    Will give him cable.

OTHELLO

    Let him do his spite:
    My services which I have done the signiory
    Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--
    Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,
    I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being
    From men of royal siege, and my demerits
    May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
    As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,
    But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
    I would not my unhoused free condition
    Put into circumscription and confine
    For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?

IAGO

    Those are the raised father and his friends:
    You were best go in.

OTHELLO

    Not I I must be found:
    My parts, my title and my perfect soul
    Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?

IAGO

    By Janus, I think no.

    [[Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches]]

OTHELLO

    The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.
    The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
    What is the news?

CASSIO

    The duke does greet you, general,
    And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
    Even on the instant.

OTHELLO

    What is the matter, think you?

CASSIO

    Something from Cyprus as I may divine:
    It is a business of some heat: the galleys
    Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
    This very night at one another's heels,
    And many of the consuls, raised and met,
    Are at the duke's already: you have been
    hotly call'd for;
    When, being not at your lodging to be found,
    The senate hath sent about three several guests
    To search you out.

OTHELLO

    'Tis well I am found by you.
    I will but spend a word here in the house,
    And go with you.

    [[Exit]]

CASSIO

    Ancient, what makes he here?

IAGO

    'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:
    If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.

CASSIO

    I do not understand.

IAGO

    He's married.

CASSIO

    To who?

    [[Re-enter OTHELLO]]

IAGO

    Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?

OTHELLO

    Have with you.

CASSIO

    Here comes another troop to seek for you.

IAGO

    It is Brabantio. General, be advised;
    He comes to bad intent.

    [[Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with torches and weapons]]

OTHELLO

    Holla! stand there!

RODERIGO

    Signior, it is the Moor.

BRABANTIO

    Down with him, thief!

    [[They draw on both sides]]

IAGO

    You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.

OTHELLO

    Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
    Good signior, you shall more command with years
    Than with your weapons.

BRABANTIO

    O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
    Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
    For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
    If she in chains of magic were not bound,
    Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,
    So opposite to marriage that she shunned
    The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
    Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
    Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
    Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.
    Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
    That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
    Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
    That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;
    'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.
    I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
    For an abuser of the world, a practiser
    Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
    Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
    Subdue him at his peril.

OTHELLO

    Hold your hands,
    Both you of my inclining, and the rest:
    Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
    Without a prompter. Where will you that I go
    To answer this your charge?

BRABANTIO

    To prison, till fit time
    Of law and course of direct session
    Call thee to answer.

OTHELLO

    What if I do obey?
    How may the duke be therewith satisfied,
    Whose messengers are here about my side,
    Upon some present business of the state
    To bring me to him?

First Officer

    'Tis true, most worthy signior;
    The duke's in council and your noble self,
    I am sure, is sent for.

BRABANTIO

    How! the duke in council!
    In this time of the night! Bring him away:
    Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,
    Or any of my brothers of the state,
    Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
    For if such actions may have passage free,
    Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.

    [[Exeunt]]

SCENE III. A council-chamber.

    [[The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending]] 

DUKE OF VENICE

    There is no composition in these news
    That gives them credit.

First Senator

    Indeed, they are disproportion'd;
    My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.

DUKE OF VENICE

    And mine, a hundred and forty.

Second Senator

    And mine, two hundred:
    But though they jump not on a just account,--
    As in these cases, where the aim reports,
    'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm
    A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:
    I do not so secure me in the error,
    But the main article I do approve
    In fearful sense.

Sailor

    [Within] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!

First Officer

    A messenger from the galleys.

    [[Enter a Sailor]]

DUKE OF VENICE

    Now, what's the business?

Sailor

    The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;
    So was I bid report here to the state
    By Signior Angelo.

DUKE OF VENICE

    How say you by this change?

First Senator

    This cannot be,
    By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,
    To keep us in false gaze. When we consider
    The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,
    And let ourselves again but understand,
    That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,
    So may he with more facile question bear it,
    For that it stands not in such warlike brace,
    But altogether lacks the abilities
    That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,
    We must not think the Turk is so unskilful
    To leave that latest which concerns him first,
    Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,
    To wake and wage a danger profitless.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.

First Officer

    Here is more news.

    [[Enter a Messenger]]

Messenger

    The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,
    Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,
    Have there injointed them with an after fleet.

First Senator

    Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?

Messenger

    Of thirty sail: and now they do restem
    Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
    Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,
    Your trusty and most valiant servitor,
    With his free duty recommends you thus,
    And prays you to believe him.

DUKE OF VENICE

    'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.
    Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?

First Senator

    He's now in Florence.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.

First Senator

    Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.

    [[Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers]]

DUKE OF VENICE

    Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
    Against the general enemy Ottoman.

    [[To BRABANTIO]]
    I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;
    We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.

BRABANTIO

    So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;
    Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
    Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care
    Take hold on me, for my particular grief
    Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
    That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
    And it is still itself.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Why, what's the matter?

BRABANTIO

    My daughter! O, my daughter!

DUKE OF VENICE Senator

    Dead?

BRABANTIO

    Ay, to me;
    She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted
    By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
    For nature so preposterously to err,
    Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
    Sans witchcraft could not.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
    Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
    And you of her, the bloody book of law
    You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
    After your own sense, yea, though our proper son
    Stood in your action.

BRABANTIO

    Humbly I thank your grace.
    Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
    Your special mandate for the state-affairs
    Hath hither brought.

DUKE OF VENICE Senator

    We are very sorry for't.

DUKE OF VENICE

    [To OTHELLO] What, in your own part, can you say to this?

BRABANTIO

    Nothing, but this is so.

OTHELLO

    Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
    My very noble and approved good masters,
    That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
    It is most true; true, I have married her:
    The very head and front of my offending
    Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
    And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:
    For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
    Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
    Their dearest action in the tented field,
    And little of this great world can I speak,
    More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
    And therefore little shall I grace my cause
    In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
    I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
    Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
    What conjuration and what mighty magic,
    For such proceeding I am charged withal,
    I won his daughter.

BRABANTIO

    A maiden never bold;
    Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
    Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
    Of years, of country, credit, every thing,
    To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
    It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
    That will confess perfection so could err
    Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
    To find out practises of cunning hell,
    Why this should be. I therefore vouch again
    That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
    Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
    He wrought upon her.

DUKE OF VENICE

    To vouch this, is no proof,
    Without more wider and more overt test
    Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
    Of modern seeming do prefer against him.

First Senator

    But, Othello, speak:
    Did you by indirect and forced courses
    Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
    Or came it by request and such fair question
    As soul to soul affordeth?

OTHELLO

    I do beseech you,
    Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
    And let her speak of me before her father:
    If you do find me foul in her report,
    The trust, the office I do hold of you,
    Not only take away, but let your sentence
    Even fall upon my life.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Fetch Desdemona hither.

OTHELLO

    Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.

    [[Exeunt IAGO and Attendants]]
    And, till she come, as truly as to heaven
    I do confess the vices of my blood,
    So justly to your grave ears I'll present
    How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,
    And she in mine.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Say it, Othello.

OTHELLO

    Her father loved me; oft invited me;
    Still question'd me the story of my life,
    From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
    That I have passed.
    I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
    To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
    Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
    Of moving accidents by flood and field
    Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
    Of being taken by the insolent foe
    And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
    And portance in my travels' history:
    Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
    Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
    It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;
    And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
    The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
    Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
    Would Desdemona seriously incline:
    But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
    Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
    She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
    Devour up my discourse: which I observing,
    Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
    To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
    That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
    Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
    But not intentively: I did consent,
    And often did beguile her of her tears,
    When I did speak of some distressful stroke
    That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
    She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
    She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
    'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
    She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
    That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,
    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
    I should but teach him how to tell my story.
    And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
    And I loved her that she did pity them.
    This only is the witchcraft I have used:
    Here comes the lady; let her witness it.

    [[Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants]]

DUKE OF VENICE

    I think this tale would win my daughter too.
    Good Brabantio,
    Take up this mangled matter at the best:
    Men do their broken weapons rather use
    Than their bare hands.

BRABANTIO

    I pray you, hear her speak:
    If she confess that she was half the wooer,
    Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
    Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:
    Do you perceive in all this noble company
    Where most you owe obedience?

DESDEMONA

    My noble father,
    I do perceive here a divided duty:
    To you I am bound for life and education;
    My life and education both do learn me
    How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;
    I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,
    And so much duty as my mother show'd
    To you, preferring you before her father,
    So much I challenge that I may profess
    Due to the Moor my lord.

BRABANTIO

    God be wi' you! I have done.
    Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:
    I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
    Come hither, Moor:
    I here do give thee that with all my heart
    Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
    I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,
    I am glad at soul I have no other child:
    For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
    To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,
    Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers
    Into your favour.
    When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
    By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
    To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
    Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
    What cannot be preserved when fortune takes
    Patience her injury a mockery makes.
    The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
    He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.

BRABANTIO

    So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
    We lose it not, so long as we can smile.
    He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
    But the free comfort which from thence he hears,
    But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
    That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
    These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
    Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
    But words are words; I never yet did hear
    That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
    I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.

DUKE OF VENICE

    The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
    Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best
    known to you; and though we have there a substitute
    of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a
    sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer
    voice on you: you must therefore be content to
    slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
    more stubborn and boisterous expedition.

OTHELLO

    The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
    Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
    My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise
    A natural and prompt alacrity
    I find in hardness, and do undertake
    These present wars against the Ottomites.
    Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
    I crave fit disposition for my wife.
    Due reference of place and exhibition,
    With such accommodation and besort
    As levels with her breeding.

DUKE OF VENICE

    If you please,
    Be't at her father's.

BRABANTIO

    I'll not have it so.

OTHELLO

    Nor I.

DESDEMONA

    Nor I; I would not there reside,
    To put my father in impatient thoughts
    By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
    To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;
    And let me find a charter in your voice,
    To assist my simpleness.

DUKE OF VENICE

    What would You, Desdemona?

DESDEMONA

    That I did love the Moor to live with him,
    My downright violence and storm of fortunes
    May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued
    Even to the very quality of my lord:
    I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
    And to his honour and his valiant parts
    Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
    So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
    A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
    The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
    And I a heavy interim shall support
    By his dear absence. Let me go with him.

OTHELLO

    Let her have your voices.
    Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,
    To please the palate of my appetite,
    Nor to comply with heat--the young affects
    In me defunct--and proper satisfaction.
    But to be free and bounteous to her mind:
    And heaven defend your good souls, that you think
    I will your serious and great business scant
    For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys
    Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness
    My speculative and officed instruments,
    That my disports corrupt and taint my business,
    Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
    And all indign and base adversities
    Make head against my estimation!

DUKE OF VENICE

    Be it as you shall privately determine,
    Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,
    And speed must answer it.

First Senator

    You must away to-night.

OTHELLO

    With all my heart.

DUKE OF VENICE

    At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
    Othello, leave some officer behind,
    And he shall our commission bring to you;
    With such things else of quality and respect
    As doth import you.

OTHELLO

    So please your grace, my ancient;
    A man he is of honest and trust:
    To his conveyance I assign my wife,
    With what else needful your good grace shall think
    To be sent after me.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Let it be so.
    Good night to every one.

    [[To BRABANTIO]]
    And, noble signior,
    If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
    Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.

First Senator

    Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.

BRABANTIO

    Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:
    She has deceived her father, and may thee.

    [[Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE, Senators, Officers, & c]]

OTHELLO

    My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
    My Desdemona must I leave to thee:
    I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:
    And bring them after in the best advantage.
    Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour
    Of love, of worldly matters and direction,
    To spend with thee: we must obey the time.

    [[Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA]]

RODERIGO

    Iago,--

IAGO

    What say'st thou, noble heart?

RODERIGO

    What will I do, thinkest thou?

IAGO

    Why, go to bed, and sleep.

RODERIGO

    I will incontinently drown myself.

IAGO

    If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,
    thou silly gentleman!

RODERIGO

    It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and
    then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.

IAGO

    O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four
    times seven years; and since I could distinguish
    betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man
    that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I
    would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I
    would change my humanity with a baboon.

RODERIGO

    What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so
    fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.

IAGO

    Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
    or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which
    our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
    nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up
    thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or
    distract it with many, either to have it sterile
    with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the
    power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
    wills. If the balance of our lives had not one
    scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the
    blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
    to most preposterous conclusions: but we have
    reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal
    stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that
    you call love to be a sect or scion.

RODERIGO

    It cannot be.

IAGO

    It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
    the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown
    cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy
    friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with
    cables of perdurable toughness; I could never
    better stead thee than now. Put money in thy
    purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with
    an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It
    cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her
    love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he
    his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou
    shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but
    money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in
    their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food
    that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be
    to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must
    change for youth: when she is sated with his body,
    she will find the error of her choice: she must
    have change, she must: therefore put money in thy
    purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a
    more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money
    thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
    an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not
    too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou
    shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of
    drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek
    thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
    to be drowned and go without her.

RODERIGO

    Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
    the issue?

IAGO

    Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told
    thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I
    hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no
    less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge
    against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost
    thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many
    events in the womb of time which will be delivered.
    Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more
    of this to-morrow. Adieu.

RODERIGO

    Where shall we meet i' the morning?

IAGO

    At my lodging.

RODERIGO

    I'll be with thee betimes.

IAGO

    Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?

RODERIGO

    What say you?

IAGO

    No more of drowning, do you hear?

RODERIGO

    I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.

    [[Exit]]

IAGO

    Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:
    For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,
    If I would time expend with such a snipe.
    But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:
    And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
    He has done my office: I know not if't be true;
    But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,
    Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;
    The better shall my purpose work on him.
    Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:
    To get his place and to plume up my will
    In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--
    After some time, to abuse Othello's ear
    That he is too familiar with his wife.
    He hath a person and a smooth dispose
    To be suspected, framed to make women false.
    The Moor is of a free and open nature,
    That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
    And will as tenderly be led by the nose
    As asses are.
    I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night
    Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.

    [[Exit]]

ACT II
SCENE I. A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.

    [[Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen]] 

MONTANO

    What from the cape can you discern at sea?

First Gentleman

    Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;
    I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,
    Descry a sail.

MONTANO

    Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
    A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:
    If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,
    What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,
    Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?

Second Gentleman

    A segregation of the Turkish fleet:
    For do but stand upon the foaming shore,
    The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;
    The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,
    seems to cast water on the burning bear,
    And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:
    I never did like molestation view
    On the enchafed flood.

MONTANO

    If that the Turkish fleet
    Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:
    It is impossible they bear it out.

    [[Enter a third Gentleman]]

Third Gentleman

    News, lads! our wars are done.
    The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,
    That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice
    Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
    On most part of their fleet.

MONTANO

    How! is this true?

Third Gentleman

    The ship is here put in,
    A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,
    Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,
    Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,
    And is in full commission here for Cyprus.

MONTANO

    I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.

Third Gentleman

    But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
    Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,
    And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
    With foul and violent tempest.

MONTANO

    Pray heavens he be;
    For I have served him, and the man commands
    Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!
    As well to see the vessel that's come in
    As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,
    Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
    An indistinct regard.

Third Gentleman

    Come, let's do so:
    For every minute is expectancy
    Of more arrivance.

    [[Enter CASSIO]]

CASSIO

    Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
    That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens
    Give him defence against the elements,
    For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.

MONTANO

    Is he well shipp'd?

CASSIO

    His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot
    Of very expert and approved allowance;
    Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
    Stand in bold cure.

    [[A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!']]

    [[Enter a fourth Gentleman]]

CASSIO

    What noise?

Fourth Gentleman

    The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea
    Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'

CASSIO

    My hopes do shape him for the governor.

    [[Guns heard]]

Second Gentlemen

    They do discharge their shot of courtesy:
    Our friends at least.

CASSIO

    I pray you, sir, go forth,
    And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.

Second Gentleman

    I shall.

    [[Exit]]

MONTANO

    But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?

CASSIO

    Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
    That paragons description and wild fame;
    One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
    And in the essential vesture of creation
    Does tire the ingener.

    [[Re-enter second Gentleman]]
    How now! who has put in?

Second Gentleman

    'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.

CASSIO

    Has had most favourable and happy speed:
    Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,
    The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--
    Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--
    As having sense of beauty, do omit
    Their mortal natures, letting go safely by
    The divine Desdemona.

MONTANO

    What is she?

CASSIO

    She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
    Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
    Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
    A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
    And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
    That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
    Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
    Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits
    And bring all Cyprus comfort!

    [[Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Attendants]]
    O, behold,
    The riches of the ship is come on shore!
    Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
    Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,
    Before, behind thee, and on every hand,
    Enwheel thee round!

DESDEMONA

    I thank you, valiant Cassio.
    What tidings can you tell me of my lord?

CASSIO

    He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
    But that he's well and will be shortly here.

DESDEMONA

    O, but I fear--How lost you company?

CASSIO

    The great contention of the sea and skies
    Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.

    [[Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard]]

Second Gentleman

    They give their greeting to the citadel;
    This likewise is a friend.

CASSIO

    See for the news.

    [[Exit Gentleman]]
    Good ancient, you are welcome.

    [[To EMILIA]]
    Welcome, mistress.
    Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
    That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
    That gives me this bold show of courtesy.

    [[Kissing her]]

IAGO

    Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
    As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,
    You'll have enough.

DESDEMONA

    Alas, she has no speech.

IAGO

    In faith, too much;
    I find it still, when I have list to sleep:
    Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,
    She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
    And chides with thinking.

EMILIA

    You have little cause to say so.

IAGO

    Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,
    Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,
    Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,
    Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.

DESDEMONA

    O, fie upon thee, slanderer!

IAGO

    Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
    You rise to play and go to bed to work.

EMILIA

    You shall not write my praise.

IAGO

    No, let me not.

DESDEMONA

    What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst
    praise me?

IAGO

    O gentle lady, do not put me to't;
    For I am nothing, if not critical.

DESDEMONA

    Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?

IAGO

    Ay, madam.

DESDEMONA

    I am not merry; but I do beguile
    The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
    Come, how wouldst thou praise me?

IAGO

    I am about it; but indeed my invention
    Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;
    It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,
    And thus she is deliver'd.
    If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,
    The one's for use, the other useth it.

DESDEMONA

    Well praised! How if she be black and witty?

IAGO

    If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
    She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.

DESDEMONA

    Worse and worse.

EMILIA

    How if fair and foolish?

IAGO

    She never yet was foolish that was fair;
    For even her folly help'd her to an heir.

DESDEMONA

    These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'
    the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for
    her that's foul and foolish?

IAGO

    There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,
    But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.

DESDEMONA

    O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.
    But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
    woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her
    merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?

IAGO

    She that was ever fair and never proud,
    Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
    Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,
    Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'
    She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,
    Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,
    She that in wisdom never was so frail
    To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;
    She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,
    See suitors following and not look behind,
    She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--

DESDEMONA

    To do what?

IAGO

    To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.

DESDEMONA

    O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn
    of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say
    you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal
    counsellor?

CASSIO

    He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in
    the soldier than in the scholar.

IAGO

    [Aside] He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,
    whisper: with as little a web as this will I
    ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon
    her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.
    You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as
    these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had
    been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
    oft, which now again you are most apt to play the
    sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent
    courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers
    to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!

    [[Trumpet within]]
    The Moor! I know his trumpet.

CASSIO

    'Tis truly so.

DESDEMONA

    Let's meet him and receive him.

CASSIO

    Lo, where he comes!

    [[Enter OTHELLO and Attendants]]

OTHELLO

    O my fair warrior!

DESDEMONA

    My dear Othello!

OTHELLO

    It gives me wonder great as my content
    To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!
    If after every tempest come such calms,
    May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
    And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
    Olympus-high and duck again as low
    As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,
    'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,
    My soul hath her content so absolute
    That not another comfort like to this
    Succeeds in unknown fate.

DESDEMONA

    The heavens forbid
    But that our loves and comforts should increase,
    Even as our days do grow!

OTHELLO

    Amen to that, sweet powers!
    I cannot speak enough of this content;
    It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
    And this, and this, the greatest discords be

    [[Kissing her]]
    That e'er our hearts shall make!

IAGO

    [Aside] O, you are well tuned now!
    But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,
    As honest as I am.

OTHELLO

    Come, let us to the castle.
    News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks
    are drown'd.
    How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
    Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;
    I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
    I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
    In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
    Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:
    Bring thou the master to the citadel;
    He is a good one, and his worthiness
    Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,
    Once more, well met at Cyprus.

    [[Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]]

IAGO

    Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come
    hither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base
    men being in love have then a nobility in their
    natures more than is native to them--list me. The
    lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
    guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is
    directly in love with him.

RODERIGO

    With him! why, 'tis not possible.

IAGO

    Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
    Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,
    but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
    and will she love him still for prating? let not
    thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
    and what delight shall she have to look on the
    devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of
    sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to
    give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,
    sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which
    the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these
    required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will
    find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,
    disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will
    instruct her in it and compel her to some second
    choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most
    pregnant and unforced position--who stands so
    eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
    does? a knave very voluble; no further
    conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
    civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing
    of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,
    none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a
    finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
    counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
    present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the
    knave is handsome, young, and hath all those
    requisites in him that folly and green minds look
    after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
    hath found him already.

RODERIGO

    I cannot believe that in her; she's full of
    most blessed condition.

IAGO

    Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of
    grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never
    have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou
    not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst
    not mark that?

RODERIGO

    Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.

IAGO

    Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue
    to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met
    so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
    together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these
    mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes
    the master and main exercise, the incorporate
    conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I
    have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;
    for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows
    you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find
    some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking
    too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what
    other course you please, which the time shall more
    favourably minister.

RODERIGO

    Well.

IAGO

    Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply
    may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for
    even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
    mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true
    taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So
    shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
    the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the
    impediment most profitably removed, without the
    which there were no expectation of our prosperity.

RODERIGO

    I will do this, if I can bring it to any
    opportunity.

IAGO

    I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:
    I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.

RODERIGO

    Adieu.

    [[Exit]]

IAGO

    That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
    That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:
    The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
    Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,
    And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
    A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;
    Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
    I stand accountant for as great a sin,
    But partly led to diet my revenge,
    For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
    Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
    Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;
    And nothing can or shall content my soul
    Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,
    Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
    At least into a jealousy so strong
    That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,
    If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
    For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
    I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
    Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--
    For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--
    Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.
    For making him egregiously an ass
    And practising upon his peace and quiet
    Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:
    Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.

    [[Exit]]

SCENE II. A street.

    [[Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People following]] 

Herald

    It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant
    general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,
    importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,
    every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,
    some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and
    revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these
    beneficial news, it is the celebration of his
    nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be
    proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full
    liberty of feasting from this present hour of five
    till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the
    isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!

    [[Exeunt]]

SCENE III. A hall in the castle.

    [[Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and Attendants]] 

OTHELLO

    Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:
    Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,
    Not to outsport discretion.

CASSIO

    Iago hath direction what to do;
    But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye
    Will I look to't.

OTHELLO

    Iago is most honest.
    Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest
    Let me have speech with you.

    [[To DESDEMONA]]
    Come, my dear love,
    The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
    That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
    Good night.

    [[Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]]

    [[Enter IAGO]]

CASSIO

    Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.

IAGO

    Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the
    clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love
    of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:
    he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and
    she is sport for Jove.

CASSIO

    She's a most exquisite lady.

IAGO

    And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.

CASSIO

    Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.

IAGO

    What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of
    provocation.

CASSIO

    An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.

IAGO

    And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?

CASSIO

    She is indeed perfection.

IAGO

    Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I
    have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace
    of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
    the health of black Othello.

CASSIO

    Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and
    unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish
    courtesy would invent some other custom of
    entertainment.

IAGO

    O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for
    you.

CASSIO

    I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was
    craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation
    it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,
    and dare not task my weakness with any more.

IAGO

    What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants
    desire it.

CASSIO

    Where are they?

IAGO

    Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.

CASSIO

    I'll do't; but it dislikes me.

    [[Exit]]

IAGO

    If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
    With that which he hath drunk to-night already,
    He'll be as full of quarrel and offence
    As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,
    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
    To Desdemona hath to-night caroused
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:
    Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
    That hold their honours in a wary distance,
    The very elements of this warlike isle,
    Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,
    And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
    Am I to put our Cassio in some action
    That may offend the isle.--But here they come:
    If consequence do but approve my dream,
    My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.

    [[Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; servants following with wine]]

CASSIO

    'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.

MONTANO

    Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am
    a soldier.

IAGO

    Some wine, ho!

    [[Sings]]
    And let me the canakin clink, clink;
    And let me the canakin clink
    A soldier's a man;
    A life's but a span;
    Why, then, let a soldier drink.
    Some wine, boys!

CASSIO

    'Fore God, an excellent song.

IAGO

    I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are
    most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and
    your swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothing
    to your English.

CASSIO

    Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?

IAGO

    Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead
    drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he
    gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle
    can be filled.

CASSIO

    To the health of our general!

MONTANO

    I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.

IAGO

    O sweet England!
    King Stephen was a worthy peer,
    His breeches cost him but a crown;
    He held them sixpence all too dear,
    With that he call'd the tailor lown.
    He was a wight of high renown,
    And thou art but of low degree:
    'Tis pride that pulls the country down;
    Then take thine auld cloak about thee.
    Some wine, ho!

CASSIO

    Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.

IAGO

    Will you hear't again?

CASSIO

    No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that
    does those things. Well, God's above all; and there
    be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.

IAGO

    It's true, good lieutenant.

CASSIO

    For mine own part,--no offence to the general, nor
    any man of quality,--I hope to be saved.

IAGO

    And so do I too, lieutenant.

CASSIO

    Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the
    lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's
    have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive
    us our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business.
    Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my
    ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:
    I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and
    speak well enough.

All

    Excellent well.

CASSIO

    Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.

    [[Exit]]

MONTANO

    To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.

IAGO

    You see this fellow that is gone before;
    He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
    And give direction: and do but see his vice;
    'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
    The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.
    I fear the trust Othello puts him in.
    On some odd time of his infirmity,
    Will shake this island.

MONTANO

    But is he often thus?

IAGO

    'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:
    He'll watch the horologe a double set,
    If drink rock not his cradle.

MONTANO

    It were well
    The general were put in mind of it.
    Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature
    Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,
    And looks not on his evils: is not this true?

    [[Enter RODERIGO]]

IAGO

    [[[Aside]] to him] How now, Roderigo!
    I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.

    [[Exit RODERIGO]]

MONTANO

    And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
    Should hazard such a place as his own second
    With one of an ingraft infirmity:
    It were an honest action to say
    So to the Moor.

IAGO

    Not I, for this fair island:
    I do love Cassio well; and would do much
    To cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise?

    [[Cry within: 'Help! help!']]

    [[Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO]]

CASSIO

    You rogue! you rascal!

MONTANO

    What's the matter, lieutenant?

CASSIO

    A knave teach me my duty!
    I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.

RODERIGO

    Beat me!

CASSIO

    Dost thou prate, rogue?

    [[Striking RODERIGO]]

MONTANO

    Nay, good lieutenant;

    [[Staying him]]
    I pray you, sir, hold your hand.

CASSIO

    Let me go, sir,
    Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.

MONTANO

    Come, come,
    you're drunk.

CASSIO

    Drunk!

    [[They fight]]

IAGO

    [Aside to RODERIGO] Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.

    [[Exit RODERIGO]]
    Nay, good lieutenant,--alas, gentlemen;--
    Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--sir;
    Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!

    [[Bell rings]]
    Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho!
    The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!
    You will be shamed for ever.

    [[Re-enter OTHELLO]] and Attendants

OTHELLO

    What is the matter here?

MONTANO

    'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.

    [[Faints]]

OTHELLO

    Hold, for your lives!

IAGO

    Hold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir--Montano,--gentlemen,--
    Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?
    Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!

OTHELLO

    Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?
    Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that
    Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
    For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:
    He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
    Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.
    Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle
    From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?
    Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,
    Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.

IAGO

    I do not know: friends all but now, even now,
    In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom
    Devesting them for bed; and then, but now--
    As if some planet had unwitted men--
    Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,
    In opposition bloody. I cannot speak
    Any beginning to this peevish odds;
    And would in action glorious I had lost
    Those legs that brought me to a part of it!

OTHELLO

    How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?

CASSIO

    I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.

OTHELLO

    Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;
    The gravity and stillness of your youth
    The world hath noted, and your name is great
    In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,
    That you unlace your reputation thus
    And spend your rich opinion for the name
    Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.

MONTANO

    Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:
    Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--
    While I spare speech, which something now
    offends me,--
    Of all that I do know: nor know I aught
    By me that's said or done amiss this night;
    Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
    And to defend ourselves it be a sin
    When violence assails us.

OTHELLO

    Now, by heaven,
    My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
    And passion, having my best judgment collied,
    Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,
    Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
    Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
    How this foul rout began, who set it on;
    And he that is approved in this offence,
    Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
    Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,
    Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
    To manage private and domestic quarrel,
    In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
    'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?

MONTANO

    If partially affined, or leagued in office,
    Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,
    Thou art no soldier.

IAGO

    Touch me not so near:
    I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
    Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;
    Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
    Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.
    Montano and myself being in speech,
    There comes a fellow crying out for help:
    And Cassio following him with determined sword,
    To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
    Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:
    Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
    Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--
    The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,
    Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather
    For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
    And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night
    I ne'er might say before. When I came back--
    For this was brief--I found them close together,
    At blow and thrust; even as again they were
    When you yourself did part them.
    More of this matter cannot I report:
    But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
    Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
    As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
    Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received
    From him that fled some strange indignity,
    Which patience could not pass.

OTHELLO

    I know, Iago,
    Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
    Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee
    But never more be officer of mine.

    [[Re-enter DESDEMONA, attended]]
    Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
    I'll make thee an example.

DESDEMONA

    What's the matter?

OTHELLO

    All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.
    Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:
    Lead him off.

    [[To MONTANO, who is led off]]
    Iago, look with care about the town,
    And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.
    Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life
    To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.

    [[Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO]]

IAGO

    What, are you hurt, lieutenant?

CASSIO

    Ay, past all surgery.

IAGO

    Marry, heaven forbid!

CASSIO

    Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost
    my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
    myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,
    Iago, my reputation!

IAGO

    As I am an honest man, I thought you had received
    some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than
    in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false
    imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without
    deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,
    unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!
    there are ways to recover the general again: you
    are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in
    policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his
    offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue
    to him again, and he's yours.

CASSIO

    I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
    good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so
    indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?
    and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse
    fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible
    spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,
    let us call thee devil!

IAGO

    What was he that you followed with your sword? What
    had he done to you?

CASSIO

    I know not.

IAGO

    Is't possible?

CASSIO

    I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;
    a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men
    should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
    their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance
    revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!

IAGO

    Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus
    recovered?

CASSIO

    It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
    to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me
    another, to make me frankly despise myself.

IAGO

    Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,
    the place, and the condition of this country
    stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;
    but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.

CASSIO

    I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me
    I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,
    such an answer would stop them all. To be now a
    sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a
    beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is
    unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.

IAGO

    Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,
    if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.
    And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.

CASSIO

    I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!

IAGO

    You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.
    I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife
    is now the general: may say so in this respect, for
    that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
    contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and
    graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune
    her help to put you in your place again: she is of
    so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
    she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
    than she is requested: this broken joint between
    you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my
    fortunes against any lay worth naming, this
    crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.

CASSIO

    You advise me well.

IAGO

    I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.

CASSIO

    I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will
    beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
    I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.

IAGO

    You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I
    must to the watch.
    CASSIO: Good night, honest Iago.

    [[Exit]]

IAGO

    And what's he then that says I play the villain?
    When this advice is free I give and honest,
    Probal to thinking and indeed the course
    To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
    The inclining Desdemona to subdue
    In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful
    As the free elements. And then for her
    To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,
    All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
    His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
    That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
    Even as her appetite shall play the god
    With his weak function. How am I then a villain
    To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
    Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
    When devils will the blackest sins put on,
    They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
    As I do now: for whiles this honest fool
    Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
    And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
    I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
    That she repeals him for her body's lust;
    And by how much she strives to do him good,
    She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
    So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
    And out of her own goodness make the net
    That shall enmesh them all.

    [[Re-enter RODERIGO]]
    How now, Roderigo!

RODERIGO

    I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that
    hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is
    almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well
    cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall
    have so much experience for my pains, and so, with
    no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.

IAGO

    How poor are they that have not patience!
    What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
    Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;
    And wit depends on dilatory time.
    Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.
    And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:
    Though other things grow fair against the sun,
    Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
    Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
    Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
    Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:
    Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:
    Nay, get thee gone.

    [[Exit RODERIGO]]
    Two things are to be done:
    My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;
    I'll set her on;
    Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
    And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
    Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way
    Dull not device by coldness and delay.

    [[Exit]]

    Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?

First Musician

    Ay, marry, are they, sir.

Clown

    O, thereby hangs a tail.

First Musician

    Whereby hangs a tale, sir?

Clown

    Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.
    But, masters, here's money for you: and the general
    so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's
    sake, to make no more noise with it.

First Musician

    Well, sir, we will not.

Clown

    If you have any music that may not be heard, to't
    again: but, as they say to hear music the general
    does not greatly care.

First Musician

    We have none such, sir.

Clown

    Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:
    go; vanish into air; away!

    [[Exeunt Musicians]]

CASSIO

    Dost thou hear, my honest friend?

Clown

    No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.

CASSIO

    Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece
    of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends
    the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's
    one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:
    wilt thou do this?

Clown

    She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I
    shall seem to notify unto her.

CASSIO

    Do, good my friend.

    [[Exit Clown]]

    [[Enter IAGO]]
    In happy time, Iago.

IAGO

    You have not been a-bed, then?

CASSIO

    Why, no; the day had broke
    Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,
    To send in to your wife: my suit to her
    Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona
    Procure me some access.

IAGO

    I'll send her to you presently;
    And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
    Out of the way, that your converse and business
    May be more free.

CASSIO

    I humbly thank you for't.

    [[Exit IAGO]]
    I never knew
    A Florentine more kind and honest.

    [[Enter EMILIA]]

EMILIA

    Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry
    For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.
    The general and his wife are talking of it;
    And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,
    That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,
    And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom
    He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
    And needs no other suitor but his likings
    To take the safest occasion by the front
    To bring you in again.

CASSIO

    Yet, I beseech you,
    If you think fit, or that it may be done,
    Give me advantage of some brief discourse
    With Desdemona alone.

EMILIA

    Pray you, come in;
    I will bestow you where you shall have time
    To speak your bosom freely.

CASSIO

    I am much bound to you.

    [[Exeunt]]

SCENE II. A room in the castle.

    [[Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Gentlemen]] 

OTHELLO

    These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;
    And by him do my duties to the senate:
    That done, I will be walking on the works;
    Repair there to me.

IAGO

    Well, my good lord, I'll do't.

OTHELLO

    This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?

Gentleman

    We'll wait upon your lordship.

    [[Exeunt]]

SCENE III. The garden of the castle.

    [[Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA]] 

DESDEMONA

    Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
    All my abilities in thy behalf.

EMILIA

    Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,
    As if the case were his.

DESDEMONA

    O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
    But I will have my lord and you again
    As friendly as you were.

CASSIO

    Bounteous madam,
    Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
    He's never any thing but your true servant.

DESDEMONA

    I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:
    You have known him long; and be you well assured
    He shall in strangeness stand no further off
    Than in a polite distance.

CASSIO

    Ay, but, lady,
    That policy may either last so long,
    Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
    Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
    That, I being absent and my place supplied,
    My general will forget my love and service.

DESDEMONA

    Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
    I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,
    If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
    To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
    I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
    His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
    I'll intermingle every thing he does
    With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;
    For thy solicitor shall rather die
    Than give thy cause away.

EMILIA

    Madam, here comes my lord.

CASSIO

    Madam, I'll take my leave.

DESDEMONA

    Why, stay, and hear me speak.

CASSIO

    Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,
    Unfit for mine own purposes.

DESDEMONA

    Well, do your discretion.

    [[Exit CASSIO]]

    [[Enter OTHELLO and IAGO]]

IAGO

    Ha! I like not that.

OTHELLO

    What dost thou say?

IAGO

    Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.

OTHELLO

    Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?

IAGO

    Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,
    That he would steal away so guilty-like,
    Seeing you coming.

OTHELLO

    I do believe 'twas he.

DESDEMONA

    How now, my lord!
    I have been talking with a suitor here,
    A man that languishes in your displeasure.

OTHELLO

    Who is't you mean?

DESDEMONA

    Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
    If I have any grace or power to move you,
    His present reconciliation take;
    For if he be not one that truly loves you,
    That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
    I have no judgment in an honest face:
    I prithee, call him back.

OTHELLO

    Went he hence now?

DESDEMONA

    Ay, sooth; so humbled
    That he hath left part of his grief with me,
    To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.

OTHELLO

    Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.

DESDEMONA

    But shall't be shortly?

OTHELLO

    The sooner, sweet, for you.

DESDEMONA

    Shall't be to-night at supper?

OTHELLO

    No, not to-night.

DESDEMONA

    To-morrow dinner, then?

OTHELLO

    I shall not dine at home;
    I meet the captains at the citadel.

DESDEMONA

    Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;
    On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
    I prithee, name the time, but let it not
    Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
    And yet his trespass, in our common reason--
    Save that, they say, the wars must make examples
    Out of their best--is not almost a fault
    To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
    Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
    What you would ask me, that I should deny,
    Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,
    That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
    When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
    Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
    To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--

OTHELLO

    Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;
    I will deny thee nothing.

DESDEMONA

    Why, this is not a boon;
    'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
    Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
    Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
    To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
    Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
    It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
    And fearful to be granted.

OTHELLO

    I will deny thee nothing:
    Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
    To leave me but a little to myself.

DESDEMONA

    Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.

OTHELLO

    Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.

DESDEMONA

    Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
    Whate'er you be, I am obedient.

    [[Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA]]

OTHELLO

    Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
    But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
    Chaos is come again.

IAGO

    My noble lord--

OTHELLO

    What dost thou say, Iago?

IAGO

    Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
    Know of your love?

OTHELLO

    He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?

IAGO

    But for a satisfaction of my thought;
    No further harm.

OTHELLO

    Why of thy thought, Iago?

IAGO

    I did not think he had been acquainted with her.

OTHELLO

    O, yes; and went between us very oft.

IAGO

    Indeed!

OTHELLO

    Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?
    Is he not honest?

IAGO

    Honest, my lord!

OTHELLO

    Honest! ay, honest.

IAGO

    My lord, for aught I know.

OTHELLO

    What dost thou think?

IAGO

    Think, my lord!

OTHELLO

    Think, my lord!
    By heaven, he echoes me,
    As if there were some monster in his thought
    Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
    I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,
    When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?
    And when I told thee he was of my counsel
    In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'
    And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
    As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
    Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,
    Show me thy thought.

IAGO

    My lord, you know I love you.

OTHELLO

    I think thou dost;
    And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,
    And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
    Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
    For such things in a false disloyal knave
    Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just
    They are close delations, working from the heart
    That passion cannot rule.

IAGO

    For Michael Cassio,
    I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.

OTHELLO

    I think so too.

IAGO

    Men should be what they seem;
    Or those that be not, would they might seem none!

OTHELLO

    Certain, men should be what they seem.

IAGO

    Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.

OTHELLO

    Nay, yet there's more in this:
    I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
    As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
    The worst of words.

IAGO

    Good my lord, pardon me:
    Though I am bound to every act of duty,
    I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
    Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
    As where's that palace whereinto foul things
    Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,
    But some uncleanly apprehensions
    Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
    With meditations lawful?

OTHELLO

    Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
    If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
    A stranger to thy thoughts.

IAGO

    I do beseech you--
    Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
    As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
    To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
    Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,
    From one that so imperfectly conceits,
    Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
    Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
    It were not for your quiet nor your good,
    Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
    To let you know my thoughts.

OTHELLO

    What dost thou mean?

IAGO

    Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
    Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
    Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
    'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
    But he that filches from me my good name
    Robs me of that which not enriches him
    And makes me poor indeed.

OTHELLO

    By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.

IAGO

    You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
    Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.

OTHELLO

    Ha!

IAGO

    O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
    It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
    The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
    Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
    But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
    Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!

OTHELLO

    O misery!

IAGO

    Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
    But riches fineless is as poor as winter
    To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
    Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
    From jealousy!

OTHELLO

    Why, why is this?
    Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,
    To follow still the changes of the moon
    With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
    Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,
    When I shall turn the business of my soul
    To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
    Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
    To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
    Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
    Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
    Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
    The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
    For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;
    I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
    And on the proof, there is no more but this,--
    Away at once with love or jealousy!

IAGO

    I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
    To show the love and duty that I bear you
    With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,
    Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
    Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
    Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:
    I would not have your free and noble nature,
    Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:
    I know our country disposition well;
    In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
    They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
    Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.

OTHELLO

    Dost thou say so?

IAGO

    She did deceive her father, marrying you;
    And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
    She loved them most.

OTHELLO

    And so she did.

IAGO

    Why, go to then;
    She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
    To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
    He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;
    I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
    For too much loving you.

OTHELLO

    I am bound to thee for ever.

IAGO

    I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.

OTHELLO

    Not a jot, not a jot.

IAGO

    I' faith, I fear it has.
    I hope you will consider what is spoke
    Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
    I am to pray you not to strain my speech
    To grosser issues nor to larger reach
    Than to suspicion.

OTHELLO

    I will not.

IAGO

    Should you do so, my lord,
    My speech should fall into such vile success
    As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--
    My lord, I see you're moved.

OTHELLO

    No, not much moved:
    I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

IAGO

    Long live she so! and long live you to think so!

OTHELLO

    And yet, how nature erring from itself,--

IAGO

    Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--
    Not to affect many proposed matches
    Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
    Whereto we see in all things nature tends--
    Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,
    Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.
    But pardon me; I do not in position
    Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
    Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
    May fall to match you with her country forms
    And happily repent.

OTHELLO

    Farewell, farewell:
    If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
    Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:

IAGO

    [Going] My lord, I take my leave.

OTHELLO

    Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
    Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.

IAGO

    [Returning] My lord, I would I might entreat
    your honour
    To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:
    Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,
    For sure, he fills it up with great ability,
    Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
    You shall by that perceive him and his means:
    Note, if your lady strain his entertainment
    With any strong or vehement importunity;
    Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
    Let me be thought too busy in my fears--
    As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
    And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.

OTHELLO

    Fear not my government.

IAGO

    I once more take my leave.

    [[Exit]]

OTHELLO

    This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
    And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
    Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
    Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,
    To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black
    And have not those soft parts of conversation
    That chamberers have, or for I am declined
    Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much--
    She's gone. I am abused; and my relief
    Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
    And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
    And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;
    Prerogatived are they less than the base;
    'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:
    Even then this forked plague is fated to us
    When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:

    [[Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA]]
    If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!
    I'll not believe't.

DESDEMONA

    How now, my dear Othello!
    Your dinner, and the generous islanders
    By you invited, do attend your presence.

OTHELLO

    I am to blame.

DESDEMONA

    Why do you speak so faintly?
    Are you not well?

OTHELLO

    I have a pain upon my forehead here.

DESDEMONA

    'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:
    Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
    It will be well.

OTHELLO

    Your napkin is too little:

    [[He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops]]
    Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.

DESDEMONA

    I am very sorry that you are not well.

    [[Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA]]

EMILIA

    I am glad I have found this napkin:
    This was her first remembrance from the Moor:
    My wayward husband hath a hundred times
    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
    That she reserves it evermore about her
    To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
    And give't Iago: what he will do with it
    Heaven knows, not I;
    I nothing but to please his fantasy.

    [[Re-enter Iago]]

IAGO

    How now! what do you here alone?

EMILIA

    Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.

IAGO

    A thing for me? it is a common thing--

EMILIA

    Ha!

IAGO

    To have a foolish wife.

EMILIA

    O, is that all? What will you give me now
    For the same handkerchief?

IAGO

    What handkerchief?

EMILIA

    What handkerchief?
    Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;
    That which so often you did bid me steal.

IAGO

    Hast stol'n it from her?

EMILIA

    No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.
    And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.
    Look, here it is.

IAGO

    A good wench; give it me.

EMILIA

    What will you do with 't, that you have been
    so earnest
    To have me filch it?

IAGO

    [Snatching it] Why, what's that to you?

EMILIA

    If it be not for some purpose of import,
    Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad
    When she shall lack it.

IAGO

    Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.

    [[Exit EMILIA]]
    I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
    And let him find it. Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.
    The Moor already changes with my poison:
    Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.
    Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
    But with a little act upon the blood.
    Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:
    Look, where he comes!

    [[Re-enter OTHELLO]]
    Not poppy, nor mandragora,
    Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
    Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
    Which thou owedst yesterday.

OTHELLO

    Ha! ha! false to me?

IAGO

    Why, how now, general! no more of that.

OTHELLO

    Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:
    I swear 'tis better to be much abused
    Than but to know't a little.

IAGO

    How now, my lord!

OTHELLO

    What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
    I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:
    I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
    I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:
    He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
    Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.

IAGO

    I am sorry to hear this.

OTHELLO

    I had been happy, if the general camp,
    Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
    So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever
    Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
    Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,
    That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
    Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
    The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
    The royal banner, and all quality,
    Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
    And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
    The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,
    Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!

IAGO

    Is't possible, my lord?

OTHELLO

    Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,
    Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:
    Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,
    Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
    Than answer my waked wrath!

IAGO

    Is't come to this?

OTHELLO

    Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,
    That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
    To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!

IAGO

    My noble lord,--

OTHELLO

    If thou dost slander her and torture me,
    Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
    On horror's head horrors accumulate;
    Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
    For nothing canst thou to damnation add
    Greater than that.

IAGO

    O grace! O heaven forgive me!
    Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
    God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.
    That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
    O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
    To be direct and honest is not safe.
    I thank you for this profit; and from hence
    I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.

OTHELLO

    Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.

IAGO

    I should be wise, for honesty's a fool
    And loses that it works for.

OTHELLO

    By the world,
    I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
    I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
    I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
    As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
    As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
    Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
    I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!

IAGO

    I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:
    I do repent me that I put it to you.
    You would be satisfied?

OTHELLO

    Would! nay, I will.

IAGO

    And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?
    Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--
    Behold her topp'd?

OTHELLO

    Death and damnation! O!

IAGO

    It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
    To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,
    If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
    More than their own! What then? how then?
    What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
    It is impossible you should see this,
    Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
    As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
    As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
    If imputation and strong circumstances,
    Which lead directly to the door of truth,
    Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.

OTHELLO

    Give me a living reason she's disloyal.

IAGO

    I do not like the office:
    But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
    Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
    I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;
    And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
    I could not sleep.
    There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
    That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
    One of this kind is Cassio:
    In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,
    Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'
    And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
    Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
    As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
    That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
    Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
    Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'

OTHELLO

    O monstrous! monstrous!

IAGO

    Nay, this was but his dream.

OTHELLO

    But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
    'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.

IAGO

    And this may help to thicken other proofs
    That do demonstrate thinly.

OTHELLO

    I'll tear her all to pieces.

IAGO

    Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
    She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
    Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
    Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?

OTHELLO

    I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.

IAGO

    I know not that; but such a handkerchief--
    I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day
    See Cassio wipe his beard with.

OTHELLO

    If it be that--

IAGO

    If it be that, or any that was hers,
    It speaks against her with the other proofs.

OTHELLO

    O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
    One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
    Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;
    All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
    'Tis gone.
    Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
    Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
    To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
    For 'tis of aspics' tongues!

IAGO

    Yet be content.

OTHELLO

    O, blood, blood, blood!

IAGO

    Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.

OTHELLO

    Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,
    Whose icy current and compulsive course
    Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
    To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
    Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
    Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
    Till that a capable and wide revenge
    Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,

    [[Kneels]]
    In the due reverence of a sacred vow
    I here engage my words.

IAGO

    Do not rise yet.

    [[Kneels]]
    Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
    You elements that clip us round about,
    Witness that here Iago doth give up
    The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
    To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
    And to obey shall be in me remorse,
    What bloody business ever.

    [[They rise]]

OTHELLO

    I greet thy love,
    Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
    And will upon the instant put thee to't:
    Within these three days let me hear thee say
    That Cassio's not alive.

IAGO

    My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:
    But let her live.

OTHELLO

    Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
    Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
    To furnish me with some swift means of death
    For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.

IAGO

    I am your own for ever.

    [[Exeunt]]

SCENE IV. Before the castle.

    [[Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown]] 

DESDEMONA

    Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?

Clown

    I dare not say he lies any where.

DESDEMONA

    Why, man?

Clown

    He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,
    is stabbing.

DESDEMONA

    Go to: where lodges he?

Clown

    To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.

DESDEMONA

    Can any thing be made of this?

Clown

    I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a
    lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were
    to lie in mine own throat.

DESDEMONA

    Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?

Clown

    I will catechise the world for him; that is, make
    questions, and by them answer.

DESDEMONA

    Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have
    moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.

Clown

    To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and
    therefore I will attempt the doing it.

    [[Exit]]

DESDEMONA

    Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?

EMILIA

    I know not, madam.

DESDEMONA

    Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
    Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor
    Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
    As jealous creatures are, it were enough
    To put him to ill thinking.

EMILIA

    Is he not jealous?

DESDEMONA

    Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
    Drew all such humours from him.

EMILIA

    Look, where he comes.

DESDEMONA

    I will not leave him now till Cassio
    Be call'd to him.

    [[Enter OTHELLO]]
    How is't with you, my lord

OTHELLO

    Well, my good lady.

    [[Aside]]
    O, hardness to dissemble!--
    How do you, Desdemona?

DESDEMONA

    Well, my good lord.

OTHELLO

    Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.

DESDEMONA

    It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.

OTHELLO

    This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:
    Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires
    A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,
    Much castigation, exercise devout;
    For here's a young and sweating devil here,
    That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,
    A frank one.

DESDEMONA

    You may, indeed, say so;
    For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.

OTHELLO

    A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;
    But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.

DESDEMONA

    I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.

OTHELLO

    What promise, chuck?

DESDEMONA

    I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.

OTHELLO

    I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
    Lend me thy handkerchief.

DESDEMONA

    Here, my lord.

OTHELLO

    That which I gave you.

DESDEMONA

    I have it not about me.

OTHELLO

    Not?

DESDEMONA

    No, indeed, my lord.

OTHELLO

    That is a fault.
    That handkerchief
    Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
    She was a charmer, and could almost read
    The thoughts of people: she told her, while
    she kept it,
    'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
    Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
    Or made gift of it, my father's eye
    Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
    After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;
    And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
    To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;
    Make it a darling like your precious eye;
    To lose't or give't away were such perdition
    As nothing else could match.

DESDEMONA

    Is't possible?

OTHELLO

    'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:
    A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
    The sun to course two hundred compasses,
    In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
    The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
    And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
    Conserved of maidens' hearts.

DESDEMONA

    Indeed! is't true?

OTHELLO

    Most veritable; therefore look to't well.

DESDEMONA

    Then would to God that I had never seen't!

OTHELLO

    Ha! wherefore?

DESDEMONA

    Why do you speak so startingly and rash?

OTHELLO

    Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out
    o' the way?

DESDEMONA

    Heaven bless us!

OTHELLO

    Say you?

DESDEMONA

    It is not lost; but what an if it were?

OTHELLO

    How!

DESDEMONA

    I say, it is not lost.

OTHELLO

    Fetch't, let me see't.

DESDEMONA

    Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
    This is a trick to put me from my suit:
    Pray you, let Cassio be received again.

OTHELLO

    Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.

DESDEMONA

    Come, come;
    You'll never meet a more sufficient man.

OTHELLO

    The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA

    I pray, talk me of Cassio.

OTHELLO

    The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA

    A man that all his time
    Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
    Shared dangers with you,--

OTHELLO

    The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA

    In sooth, you are to blame.

OTHELLO

    Away!

    [[Exit]]

EMILIA

    Is not this man jealous?

DESDEMONA

    I ne'er saw this before.
    Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:
    I am most unhappy in the loss of it.

EMILIA

    'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
    They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;
    To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,
    They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!

    [[Enter CASSIO and IAGO]]

IAGO

    There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:
    And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.

DESDEMONA

    How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?

CASSIO

    Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
    That by your virtuous means I may again
    Exist, and be a member of his love
    Whom I with all the office of my heart
    Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.
    If my offence be of such mortal kind
    That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
    Nor purposed merit in futurity,
    Can ransom me into his love again,
    But to know so must be my benefit;
    So shall I clothe me in a forced content,
    And shut myself up in some other course,
    To fortune's alms.

DESDEMONA

    Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
    My advocation is not now in tune;
    My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
    Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
    So help me every spirit sanctified,
    As I have spoken for you all my best
    And stood within the blank of his displeasure
    For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
    What I can do I will; and more I will
    Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.

IAGO

    Is my lord angry?

EMILIA

    He went hence but now,
    And certainly in strange unquietness.

IAGO

    Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
    When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
    And, like the devil, from his very arm
    Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?
    Something of moment then: I will go meet him:
    There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.

DESDEMONA

    I prithee, do so.

    [[Exit IAGO]]
    Something, sure, of state,
    Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise
    Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
    Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases
    Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,
    Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;
    For let our finger ache, and it indues
    Our other healthful members even to that sense
    Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
    Nor of them look for such observances
    As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,
    I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
    Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
    But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
    And he's indicted falsely.

EMILIA

    Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,
    And no conception nor no jealous toy
    Concerning you.

DESDEMONA

    Alas the day! I never gave him cause.

EMILIA

    But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
    They are not ever jealous for the cause,
    But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster
    Begot upon itself, born on itself.

DESDEMONA

    Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!

EMILIA

    Lady, amen.

DESDEMONA

    I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:
    If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit
    And seek to effect it to my uttermost.

CASSIO

    I humbly thank your ladyship.

    [[Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA]]

    [[Enter BIANCA]]

BIANCA

    Save you, friend Cassio!

CASSIO

    What make you from home?
    How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?
    I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.

BIANCA

    And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
    What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?
    Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,
    More tedious than the dial eight score times?
    O weary reckoning!

CASSIO

    Pardon me, Bianca:
    I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:
    But I shall, in a more continuate time,
    Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,

    [[Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief]]
    Take me this work out.

BIANCA

    O Cassio, whence came this?
    This is some token from a newer friend:
    To the felt absence now I feel a cause:
    Is't come to this? Well, well.

CASSIO

    Go to, woman!
    Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,
    From whence you have them. You are jealous now
    That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:
    No, in good troth, Bianca.

BIANCA

    Why, whose is it?

CASSIO

    I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.
    I like the work well: ere it be demanded--
    As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:
    Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.

BIANCA

    Leave you! wherefore?

CASSIO

    I do attend here on the general;
    And think it no addition, nor my wish,
    To have him see me woman'd.

BIANCA

    Why, I pray you?

CASSIO

    Not that I love you not.

BIANCA

    But that you do not love me.
    I pray you, bring me on the way a little,
    And say if I shall see you soon at night.

CASSIO

    'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;
    For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.

BIANCA

    'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.

    [[Exeunt]]

ACT IV
SCENE I. Cyprus. Before the castle.

    [[Enter OTHELLO and IAGO]] 

IAGO

    Will you think so?

OTHELLO

    Think so, Iago!

IAGO

    What,
    To kiss in private?

OTHELLO

    An unauthorized kiss.

IAGO

    Or to be naked with her friend in bed
    An hour or more, not meaning any harm?

OTHELLO

    Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
    It is hypocrisy against the devil:
    They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,
    The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.

IAGO

    So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:
    But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--

OTHELLO

    What then?

IAGO

    Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,
    She may, I think, bestow't on any man.

OTHELLO

    She is protectress of her honour too:
    May she give that?

IAGO

    Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
    They have it very oft that have it not:
    But, for the handkerchief,--

OTHELLO

    By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
    Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,
    As doth the raven o'er the infected house,
    Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.

IAGO

    Ay, what of that?

OTHELLO

    That's not so good now.

IAGO

    What,
    If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
    Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,
    Who having, by their own importunate suit,
    Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,
    Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose
    But they must blab--

OTHELLO

    Hath he said any thing?

IAGO

    He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
    No more than he'll unswear.

OTHELLO

    What hath he said?

IAGO

    'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.

OTHELLO

    What? what?

IAGO

    Lie--

OTHELLO

    With her?

IAGO

    With her, on her; what you will.

OTHELLO

    Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when
    they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.
    --Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To
    confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be
    hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.
    Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
    passion without some instruction. It is not words
    that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
    --Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--

    [[Falls in a trance]]

IAGO

    Work on,
    My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;
    And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
    All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!
    My lord, I say! Othello!

    [[Enter CASSIO]]
    How now, Cassio!

CASSIO

    What's the matter?

IAGO

    My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:
    This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.

CASSIO

    Rub him about the temples.

IAGO

    No, forbear;
    The lethargy must have his quiet course:
    If not, he foams at mouth and by and by
    Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:
    Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
    He will recover straight: when he is gone,
    I would on great occasion speak with you.

    [[Exit CASSIO]]
    How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?

OTHELLO

    Dost thou mock me?

IAGO

    I mock you! no, by heaven.
    Would you would bear your fortune like a man!

OTHELLO

    A horned man's a monster and a beast.

IAGO

    There's many a beast then in a populous city,
    And many a civil monster.

OTHELLO

    Did he confess it?

IAGO

    Good sir, be a man;
    Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
    May draw with you: there's millions now alive
    That nightly lie in those unproper beds
    Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.
    O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
    To lip a wanton in a secure couch,
    And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;
    And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.

OTHELLO

    O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.

IAGO

    Stand you awhile apart;
    Confine yourself but in a patient list.
    Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--
    A passion most unsuiting such a man--
    Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
    And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,
    Bade him anon return and here speak with me;
    The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,
    And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
    That dwell in every region of his face;
    For I will make him tell the tale anew,
    Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
    He hath, and is again to cope your wife:
    I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;
    Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
    And nothing of a man.

OTHELLO

    Dost thou hear, Iago?
    I will be found most cunning in my patience;
    But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.

IAGO

    That's not amiss;
    But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?

    [[OTHELLO retires]]
    Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
    A housewife that by selling her desires
    Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature
    That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague
    To beguile many and be beguiled by one:
    He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
    From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:

    [[Re-enter CASSIO]]
    As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
    And his unbookish jealousy must construe
    Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,
    Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?

CASSIO

    The worser that you give me the addition
    Whose want even kills me.

IAGO

    Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.

    [[Speaking lower]]
    Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,
    How quickly should you speed!

CASSIO

    Alas, poor caitiff!

OTHELLO

    Look, how he laughs already!

IAGO

    I never knew woman love man so.

CASSIO

    Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.

OTHELLO

    Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.

IAGO

    Do you hear, Cassio?

OTHELLO

    Now he importunes him
    To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.

IAGO

    She gives it out that you shall marry hey:
    Do you intend it?

CASSIO

    Ha, ha, ha!

OTHELLO

    Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?

CASSIO

    I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some
    charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.
    Ha, ha, ha!

OTHELLO

    So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.

IAGO

    'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.

CASSIO

    Prithee, say true.

IAGO

    I am a very villain else.

OTHELLO

    Have you scored me? Well.

CASSIO

    This is the monkey's own giving out: she is
    persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and
    flattery, not out of my promise.

OTHELLO

    Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.

CASSIO

    She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
    I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with
    certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,
    and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--

OTHELLO

    Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture
    imports it.

CASSIO

    So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,
    and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!

OTHELLO

    Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,
    I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall
    throw it to.

CASSIO

    Well, I must leave her company.

IAGO

    Before me! look, where she comes.

CASSIO

    'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.

    [[Enter BIANCA]]
    What do you mean by this haunting of me?

BIANCA

    Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you
    mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?
    I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the
    work?--A likely piece of work, that you should find
    it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!
    This is some minx's token, and I must take out the
    work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever
    you had it, I'll take out no work on't.

CASSIO

    How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!

OTHELLO

    By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!

BIANCA

    An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you
    will not, come when you are next prepared for.

    [[Exit]]

IAGO

    After her, after her.

CASSIO

    'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.

IAGO

    Will you sup there?

CASSIO

    'Faith, I intend so.

IAGO

    Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain
    speak with you.

CASSIO

    Prithee, come; will you?

IAGO

    Go to; say no more.

    [[Exit CASSIO]]

OTHELLO

    [Advancing] How shall I murder him, Iago?

IAGO

    Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?

OTHELLO

    O Iago!

IAGO

    And did you see the handkerchief?

OTHELLO

    Was that mine?

IAGO

    Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the
    foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he
    hath given it his whore.

OTHELLO

    I would have him nine years a-killing.
    A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!

IAGO

    Nay, you must forget that.

OTHELLO

    Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;
    for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to
    stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the
    world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by
    an emperor's side and command him tasks.

IAGO

    Nay, that's not your way.

OTHELLO

    Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate
    with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she
    will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high
    and plenteous wit and invention:--

IAGO

    She's the worse for all this.

OTHELLO

    O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so
    gentle a condition!

IAGO

    Ay, too gentle.

OTHELLO

    Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!
    O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!

IAGO

    If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her
    patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes
    near nobody.

OTHELLO

    I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!

IAGO

    O, 'tis foul in her.

OTHELLO

    With mine officer!

IAGO

    That's fouler.

OTHELLO

    Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not
    expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty
    unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.

IAGO

    Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even
    the bed she hath contaminated.

OTHELLO

    Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.

IAGO

    And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you
    shall hear more by midnight.

OTHELLO

    Excellent good.

    [[A trumpet within]]
    What trumpet is that same?

IAGO

    Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico
    Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.

    [[Enter LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]]

LODOVICO

    Save you, worthy general!

OTHELLO

    With all my heart, sir.

LODOVICO

    The duke and senators of Venice greet you.

    [[Gives him a letter]]

OTHELLO

    I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.

    [[Opens the letter, and reads]]

DESDEMONA

    And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?

IAGO

    I am very glad to see you, signior
    Welcome to Cyprus.

LODOVICO

    I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?

IAGO

    Lives, sir.

DESDEMONA

    Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
    An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.

OTHELLO

    Are you sure of that?

DESDEMONA

    My lord?

OTHELLO

    [Reads] 'This fail you not to do, as you will--'

LODOVICO

    He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
    Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?

DESDEMONA

    A most unhappy one: I would do much
    To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.

OTHELLO

    Fire and brimstone!

DESDEMONA

    My lord?

OTHELLO

    Are you wise?

DESDEMONA

    What, is he angry?

LODOVICO

    May be the letter moved him;
    For, as I think, they do command him home,
    Deputing Cassio in his government.

DESDEMONA

    Trust me, I am glad on't.

OTHELLO

    Indeed!

DESDEMONA

    My lord?

OTHELLO

    I am glad to see you mad.

DESDEMONA

    Why, sweet Othello,--

OTHELLO

    [Striking her] Devil!

DESDEMONA

    I have not deserved this.

LODOVICO

    My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,
    Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:
    Make her amends; she weeps.

OTHELLO

    O devil, devil!
    If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,
    Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
    Out of my sight!

DESDEMONA

    I will not stay to offend you.

    [[Going]]

LODOVICO

    Truly, an obedient lady:
    I do beseech your lordship, call her back.

OTHELLO

    Mistress!

DESDEMONA

    My lord?

OTHELLO

    What would you with her, sir?

LODOVICO

    Who, I, my lord?

OTHELLO

    Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:
    Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,
    And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
    And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,
    Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.
    Concerning this, sir,--O well-painted passion!--
    I am commanded home. Get you away;
    I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,
    And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!

    [[Exit DESDEMONA]]
    Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,
    I do entreat that we may sup together:
    You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys!

    [[Exit]]

LODOVICO

    Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
    Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature
    Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue
    The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,
    Could neither graze nor pierce?

IAGO

    He is much changed.

LODOVICO

    Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?

IAGO

    He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure
    What he might be: if what he might he is not,
    I would to heaven he were!

LODOVICO

    What, strike his wife!

IAGO

    'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
    That stroke would prove the worst!

LODOVICO

    Is it his use?
    Or did the letters work upon his blood,
    And new-create this fault?

IAGO

    Alas, alas!
    It is not honesty in me to speak
    What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,
    And his own courses will denote him so
    That I may save my speech: do but go after,
    And mark how he continues.

LODOVICO

    I am sorry that I am deceived in him.

    [[Exeunt]]

SCENE II. A room in the castle.

    [[Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA]]

OTHELLO

    You have seen nothing then?

EMILIA

    Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.

OTHELLO

    Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.

EMILIA

    But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
    Each syllable that breath made up between them.

OTHELLO

    What, did they never whisper?

EMILIA

    Never, my lord.

OTHELLO

    Nor send you out o' the way?

EMILIA

    Never.

OTHELLO

    To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?

EMILIA

    Never, my lord.

OTHELLO

    That's strange.

EMILIA

    I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
    Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,
    Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
    If any wretch have put this in your head,
    Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
    For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
    There's no man happy; the purest of their wives
    Is foul as slander.

OTHELLO

    Bid her come hither: go.

    [[Exit EMILIA]]
    She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
    That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
    A closet lock and key of villanous secrets
    And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.

    [[Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA]]

DESDEMONA

    My lord, what is your will?

OTHELLO

    Pray, chuck, come hither.

DESDEMONA

    What is your pleasure?

OTHELLO

    Let me see your eyes;
    Look in my face.

DESDEMONA

    What horrible fancy's this?

OTHELLO

    [To EMILIA] Some of your function, mistress;
    Leave procreants alone and shut the door;
    Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:
    Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.

    [[Exit EMILIA]]

DESDEMONA

    Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
    I understand a fury in your words.
    But not the words.

OTHELLO

    Why, what art thou?

DESDEMONA

    Your wife, my lord; your true
    And loyal wife.

OTHELLO

    Come, swear it, damn thyself
    Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
    Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:
    Swear thou art honest.

DESDEMONA

    Heaven doth truly know it.

OTHELLO

    Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.

DESDEMONA

    To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?

OTHELLO

    O Desdemona! away! away! away!

DESDEMONA

    Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
    Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
    If haply you my father do suspect
    An instrument of this your calling back,
    Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,
    Why, I have lost him too.

OTHELLO

    Had it pleased heaven
    To try me with affliction; had they rain'd
    All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.
    Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,
    Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,
    I should have found in some place of my soul
    A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me
    A fixed figure for the time of scorn
    To point his slow unmoving finger at!
    Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:
    But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,
    Where either I must live, or bear no life;
    The fountain from the which my current runs,
    Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
    Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
    To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,
    Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,--
    Ay, there, look grim as hell!

DESDEMONA

    I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.

OTHELLO

    O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,
    That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,
    Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
    That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst
    ne'er been born!

DESDEMONA

    Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?

OTHELLO

    Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
    Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!
    Committed! O thou public commoner!
    I should make very forges of my cheeks,
    That would to cinders burn up modesty,
    Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!
    Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,
    The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
    Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,
    And will not hear it. What committed!
    Impudent strumpet!

DESDEMONA

    By heaven, you do me wrong.

OTHELLO

    Are you not a strumpet?

DESDEMONA

    No, as I am a Christian:
    If to preserve this vessel for my lord
    From any other foul unlawful touch
    Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.

OTHELLO

    What, not a whore?

DESDEMONA

    No, as I shall be saved.

OTHELLO

    Is't possible?

DESDEMONA

    O, heaven forgive us!

OTHELLO

    I cry you mercy, then:
    I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
    That married with Othello.

    [[Raising his voice]]
    You, mistress,
    That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
    And keep the gate of hell!

    [[Re-enter EMILIA]]
    You, you, ay, you!
    We have done our course; there's money for your pains:
    I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.

    [[Exit]]

EMILIA

    Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
    How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?

DESDEMONA

    'Faith, half asleep.

EMILIA

    Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?

DESDEMONA

    With who?

EMILIA

    Why, with my lord, madam.

DESDEMONA

    Who is thy lord?

EMILIA

    He that is yours, sweet lady.

DESDEMONA

    I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;
    I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,
    But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight
    Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;
    And call thy husband hither.

EMILIA

    Here's a change indeed!

    [[Exit]]

DESDEMONA

    'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
    How have I been behaved, that he might stick
    The small'st opinion on my least misuse?

    [[Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO]]

IAGO

    What is your pleasure, madam?
    How is't with you?

DESDEMONA

    I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
    Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:
    He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,
    I am a child to chiding.

IAGO

    What's the matter, lady?

EMILIA

    Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.
    Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
    As true hearts cannot bear.

DESDEMONA

    Am I that name, Iago?

IAGO

    What name, fair lady?

DESDEMONA

    Such as she says my lord did say I was.

EMILIA

    He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink
    Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.

IAGO

    Why did he so?

DESDEMONA

    I do not know; I am sure I am none such.

IAGO

    Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!

EMILIA

    Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
    Her father and her country and her friends,
    To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?

DESDEMONA

    It is my wretched fortune.

IAGO

    Beshrew him for't!
    How comes this trick upon him?

DESDEMONA

    Nay, heaven doth know.

EMILIA

    I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
    Some busy and insinuating rogue,
    Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
    Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.

IAGO

    Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.

DESDEMONA

    If any such there be, heaven pardon him!

EMILIA

    A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!
    Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?
    What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?
    The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,
    Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
    O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,
    And put in every honest hand a whip
    To lash the rascals naked through the world
    Even from the east to the west!

IAGO

    Speak within door.

EMILIA

    O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
    That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
    And made you to suspect me with the Moor.

IAGO

    You are a fool; go to.

DESDEMONA

    O good Iago,
    What shall I do to win my lord again?
    Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,
    I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
    If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
    Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
    Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
    Delighted them in any other form;
    Or that I do not yet, and ever did.
    And ever will--though he do shake me off
    To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,
    Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;
    And his unkindness may defeat my life,
    But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'
    It does abhor me now I speak the word;
    To do the act that might the addition earn
    Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.

IAGO

    I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:
    The business of the state does him offence,
    And he does chide with you.

DESDEMONA

    If 'twere no other--

IAGO

    'Tis but so, I warrant.

    [[Trumpets within]]
    Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
    The messengers of Venice stay the meat;
    Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.

    [[Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA]]

    [[Enter RODERIGO]]
    How now, Roderigo!

RODERIGO

    I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.

IAGO

    What in the contrary?

RODERIGO

    Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;
    and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me
    all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
    advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure
    it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what
    already I have foolishly suffered.

IAGO

    Will you hear me, Roderigo?

RODERIGO

    'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
    performances are no kin together.

IAGO

    You charge me most unjustly.

RODERIGO

    With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of
    my means. The jewels you have had from me to
    deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a
    votarist: you have told me she hath received them
    and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
    respect and acquaintance, but I find none.

IAGO

    Well; go to; very well.

RODERIGO

    Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis
    not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin
    to find myself fobbed in it.

IAGO

    Very well.

RODERIGO

    I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself
    known to Desdemona: if she will return me my
    jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my
    unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I
    will seek satisfaction of you.

IAGO

    You have said now.

RODERIGO

    Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.

IAGO

    Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from
    this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
    ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast
    taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I
    protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.

RODERIGO

    It hath not appeared.

IAGO

    I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your
    suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,
    Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I
    have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean
    purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if
    thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,
    take me from this world with treachery and devise
    engines for my life.

RODERIGO

    Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?

IAGO

    Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice
    to depute Cassio in Othello's place.

RODERIGO

    Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona
    return again to Venice.

IAGO

    O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with
    him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be
    lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
    so determinate as the removing of Cassio.

RODERIGO

    How do you mean, removing of him?

IAGO

    Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;
    knocking out his brains.

RODERIGO

    And that you would have me to do?

IAGO

    Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
    He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I
    go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable
    fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which
    I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,
    you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near
    to second your attempt, and he shall fall between
    us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with
    me; I will show you such a necessity in his death
    that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
    him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows
    to waste: about it.

RODERIGO

    I will hear further reason for this.

IAGO

    And you shall be satisfied.

    [[Exeunt]]

SCENE III. Another room In the castle.

    [[Enter OTHELLO, LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, EMILIA and Attendants]]

LODOVICO

    I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.

OTHELLO

    O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.

LODOVICO

    Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.

DESDEMONA

    Your honour is most welcome.

OTHELLO

    Will you walk, sir?
    O,--Desdemona,--

DESDEMONA

    My lord?

OTHELLO

    Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
    forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.

DESDEMONA

    I will, my lord.

    [[Exeunt OTHELLO, LODOVICO, and Attendants]]

EMILIA

    How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.

DESDEMONA

    He says he will return incontinent:
    He hath commanded me to go to bed,
    And bade me to dismiss you.

EMILIA

    Dismiss me!

DESDEMONA

    It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,.
    Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:
    We must not now displease him.

EMILIA

    I would you had never seen him!

DESDEMONA

    So would not I my love doth so approve him,
    That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--
    Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.

EMILIA

    I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.

DESDEMONA

    All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
    If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me
    In one of those same sheets.

EMILIA

    Come, come you talk.

DESDEMONA

    My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:
    She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
    And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'
    An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,
    And she died singing it: that song to-night
    Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,
    But to go hang my head all at one side,
    And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.

EMILIA

    Shall I go fetch your night-gown?

DESDEMONA

    No, unpin me here.
    This Lodovico is a proper man.

EMILIA

    A very handsome man.

DESDEMONA

    He speaks well.

EMILIA

    I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot
    to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.

DESDEMONA

    [Singing] The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,
    Sing all a green willow:
    Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,
    Sing willow, willow, willow:
    The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;
    Sing willow, willow, willow;
    Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;
    Lay by these:--

    [[Singing]]
    Sing willow, willow, willow;
    Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:--

    [[Singing]]
    Sing all a green willow must be my garland.
    Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,-
    Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?

EMILIA

    It's the wind.

DESDEMONA

    [Singing] I call'd my love false love; but what
    said he then?
    Sing willow, willow, willow:
    If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!
    So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;
    Doth that bode weeping?

EMILIA

    'Tis neither here nor there.

DESDEMONA

    I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
    Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--
    That there be women do abuse their husbands
    In such gross kind?

EMILIA

    There be some such, no question.

DESDEMONA

    Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

EMILIA

    Why, would not you?

DESDEMONA

    No, by this heavenly light!

EMILIA

    Nor I neither by this heavenly light;
    I might do't as well i' the dark.

DESDEMONA

    Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

EMILIA

    The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.
    For a small vice.

DESDEMONA

    In troth, I think thou wouldst not.

EMILIA

    In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had
    done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a
    joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for
    gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty
    exhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who would
    not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
    monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.

DESDEMONA

    Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
    For the whole world.

EMILIA

    Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and
    having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your
    own world, and you might quickly make it right.

DESDEMONA

    I do not think there is any such woman.

EMILIA

    Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would
    store the world they played for.
    But I do think it is their husbands' faults
    If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,
    And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
    Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
    Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,
    Or scant our former having in despite;
    Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
    Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
    Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
    And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
    As husbands have. What is it that they do
    When they change us for others? Is it sport?
    I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
    I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?
    It is so too: and have not we affections,
    Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
    Then let them use us well: else let them know,
    The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

DESDEMONA

    Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,
    Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!

    [[Exeunt]]

ACT V
SCENE I. Cyprus. A street.

    [[Enter IAGO and RODERIGO]]

IAGO

    Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:
    Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:
    Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:
    It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,
    And fix most firm thy resolution.

RODERIGO

    Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.

IAGO

    Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.

    [[Retires]]

RODERIGO

    I have no great devotion to the deed;
    And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:
    'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.

IAGO

    I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
    And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
    Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
    Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,
    He calls me to a restitution large
    Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
    As gifts to Desdemona;
    It must not be: if Cassio do remain,
    He hath a daily beauty in his life
    That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor
    May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:
    No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.

    [[Enter CASSIO]]

RODERIGO

    I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest!

    [[Makes a pass at CASSIO]]

CASSIO

    That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
    But that my coat is better than thou know'st
    I will make proof of thine.

    [[Draws, and wounds RODERIGO]]

RODERIGO

    O, I am slain!

    [[IAGO from behind wounds CASSIO in the leg, and exit]]

CASSIO

    I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder!

    [[Falls]]

    [[Enter OTHELLO]]

OTHELLO

    The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.

RODERIGO

    O, villain that I am!

OTHELLO

    It is even so.

CASSIO

    O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!

OTHELLO

    'Tis he:--O brave Iago, honest and just,
    That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
    Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
    And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.
    Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
    Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted.

    [[Exit]]

    [[Enter LODOVICO and GRATIANO]]

CASSIO

    What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!

GRATIANO

    'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.

CASSIO

    O, help!

LODOVICO

    Hark!

RODERIGO

    O wretched villain!

LODOVICO

    Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:
    These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
    To come in to the cry without more help.

RODERIGO

    Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.

LODOVICO

    Hark!

    [[Re-enter IAGO, with a light]]

GRATIANO

    Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.

IAGO

    Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?

LODOVICO

    We do not know.

IAGO

    Did not you hear a cry?

CASSIO

    Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!

IAGO

    What's the matter?

GRATIANO

    This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.

LODOVICO

    The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.

IAGO

    What are you here that cry so grievously?

CASSIO

    Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
    Give me some help.

IAGO

    O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?

CASSIO

    I think that one of them is hereabout,
    And cannot make away.

IAGO

    O treacherous villains!
    What are you there? come in, and give some help.

    [[To LODOVICO and GRATIANO]]

RODERIGO

    O, help me here!

CASSIO

    That's one of them.

IAGO

    O murderous slave! O villain!

    [[Stabs RODERIGO]]

RODERIGO

    O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!

IAGO

    Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--
    How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!--
    What may you be? are you of good or evil?

LODOVICO

    As you shall prove us, praise us.

IAGO

    Signior Lodovico?

LODOVICO

    He, sir.

IAGO

    I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.

GRATIANO

    Cassio!

IAGO

    How is't, brother!

CASSIO

    My leg is cut in two.

IAGO

    Marry, heaven forbid!
    Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.

    [[Enter BIANCA]]

BIANCA

    What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?

IAGO

    Who is't that cried!

BIANCA

    O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,
    Cassio, Cassio!

IAGO

    O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
    Who they should be that have thus many led you?

CASSIO

    No.

GRATIANO

    I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.

IAGO

    Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
    To bear him easily hence!

BIANCA

    Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!

IAGO

    Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
    To be a party in this injury.
    Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
    Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
    Alas my friend and my dear countryman
    Roderigo! no:--yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.

GRATIANO

    What, of Venice?

IAGO

    Even he, sir; did you know him?

GRATIANO

    Know him! ay.

IAGO

    Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
    These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,
    That so neglected you.

GRATIANO

    I am glad to see you.

IAGO

    How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!

GRATIANO

    Roderigo!

IAGO

    He, he 'tis he.

    [[A chair brought in]]
    O, that's well said; the chair!

GRATIANO

    Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
    I'll fetch the general's surgeon.

    [[To BIANCA]]
    For you, mistress,
    Save you your labour. He that lies slain
    here, Cassio,
    Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?

CASSIO

    None in the world; nor do I know the man.

IAGO

    [To BIANCA] What, look you pale? O, bear him out
    o' the air.

    [[CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off]]
    Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?
    Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
    Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
    Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:
    Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,
    Though tongues were out of use.

    [[Enter EMILIA]]

EMILIA

    'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?

IAGO

    Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
    By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:
    He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.

EMILIA

    Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!

IAGO

    This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
    Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.

    [[To BIANCA]]
    What, do you shake at that?

BIANCA

    He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.

IAGO

    O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.

EMILIA

    Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!

BIANCA

    I am no strumpet; but of life as honest
    As you that thus abuse me.

EMILIA

    As I! foh! fie upon thee!

IAGO

    Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
    Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
    Emilia run you to the citadel,
    And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.
    Will you go on? I pray.

    [[Aside]]
    This is the night
    That either makes me or fordoes me quite.

    [[Exeunt]]

SCENE II. A bedchamber in the castle

    [[DESDEMONA in bed asleep; a light burning.]]

    [[Enter OTHELLO]]

OTHELLO

    It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,--
    Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!--
    It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;
    Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,
    And smooth as monumental alabaster.
    Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
    Put out the light, and then put out the light:
    If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
    I can again thy former light restore,
    Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,
    Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,
    I know not where is that Promethean heat
    That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,
    I cannot give it vital growth again.
    It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.

    [[Kissing her]]
    Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
    Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.
    Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
    And love thee after. One more, and this the last:
    So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
    But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;
    It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.

DESDEMONA

    Who's there? Othello?

OTHELLO

    Ay. Desdemona.

DESDEMONA

    Will you come to bed, my lord?

OTHELLO

    Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?

DESDEMONA

    Ay, my lord.

OTHELLO

    If you bethink yourself of any crime
    Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,
    Solicit for it straight.

DESDEMONA

    Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?

OTHELLO

    Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:
    I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;
    No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.

DESDEMONA

    Talk you of killing?

OTHELLO

    Ay, I do.

DESDEMONA

    Then heaven
    Have mercy on me!

OTHELLO

    Amen, with all my heart!

DESDEMONA

    If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.

OTHELLO

    Hum!

DESDEMONA

    And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then
    When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,
    Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.

OTHELLO

    Think on thy sins.

DESDEMONA

    They are loves I bear to you.

OTHELLO

    Ay, and for that thou diest.

DESDEMONA

    That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
    Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
    Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
    These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,
    They do not point on me.

OTHELLO

    Peace, and be still!

DESDEMONA

    I will so. What's the matter?

OTHELLO

    That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
    Thou gavest to Cassio.

DESDEMONA

    No, by my life and soul!
    Send for the man, and ask him.

OTHELLO

    Sweet soul, take heed,
    Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.

DESDEMONA

    Ay, but not yet to die.

OTHELLO

    Yes, presently:
    Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;
    For to deny each article with oath
    Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
    That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

DESDEMONA

    Then Lord have mercy on me!

OTHELLO

    I say, amen.

DESDEMONA

    And have you mercy too! I never did
    Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio
    But with such general warranty of heaven
    As I might love: I never gave him token.

OTHELLO

    By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.
    O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,
    And makest me call what I intend to do
    A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:
    I saw the handkerchief.

DESDEMONA

    He found it then;
    I never gave it him: send for him hither;
    Let him confess a truth.

OTHELLO

    He hath confess'd.

DESDEMONA

    What, my lord?

OTHELLO

    That he hath used thee.

DESDEMONA

    How? unlawfully?

OTHELLO

    Ay.

DESDEMONA

    He will not say so.

OTHELLO

    No, his mouth is stopp'd;
    Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.

DESDEMONA

    O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?

OTHELLO

    Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
    Had stomach for them all.

DESDEMONA

    Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.

OTHELLO

    Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?

DESDEMONA

    O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

OTHELLO

    Down, strumpet!

DESDEMONA

    Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!

OTHELLO

    Nay, if you strive--

DESDEMONA

    But half an hour!

OTHELLO

    Being done, there is no pause.

DESDEMONA

    But while I say one prayer!

OTHELLO

    It is too late.

    [[He stifles her]]

EMILIA

    [Within] My lord , my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord!

OTHELLO

    What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
    I that am cruel am yet merciful;
    I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so.

EMILIA

    [Within] What, ho! my lord, my lord!

OTHELLO

    Who's there?

EMILIA

    [Within] O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!

OTHELLO

    Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.
    'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.--
    The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?
    Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?--
    I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do?
    If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:
    My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.
    O insupportable! O heavy hour!
    Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
    Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe
    Should yawn at alteration.

EMILIA

    [Within] I do beseech you
    That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!

OTHELLO

    I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia;
    Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
    Where art thou?

    [[Unlocks the door]]

    [[Enter EMILIA]]
    What's the matter with thee now?

EMILIA

    O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!

OTHELLO

    What, now?

EMILIA

    But now, my lord.

OTHELLO

    It is the very error of the moon;
    She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,
    And makes men mad.

EMILIA

    Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
    Call'd Roderigo.

OTHELLO

    Roderigo kill'd!
    And Cassio kill'd!

EMILIA

    No, Cassio is not kill'd.

OTHELLO

    Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune,
    And sweet revenge grows harsh.

DESDEMONA

    O, falsely, falsely murder'd!

EMILIA

    Alas, what cry is that?

OTHELLO

    That! what?

EMILIA

    Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.
    Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!
    Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!

DESDEMONA

    A guiltless death I die.

EMILIA

    O, who hath done this deed?

DESDEMONA

    Nobody; I myself. Farewell
    Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!

    [[Dies]]

OTHELLO

    Why, how should she be murder'd?

EMILIA

    Alas, who knows?

OTHELLO

    You heard her say herself, it was not I.

EMILIA

    She said so: I must needs report the truth.

OTHELLO

    She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:
    'Twas I that kill'd her.

EMILIA

    O, the more angel she,
    And you the blacker devil!

OTHELLO

    She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.

EMILIA

    Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.

OTHELLO

    She was false as water.

EMILIA

    Thou art rash as fire, to say
    That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!

OTHELLO

    Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
    O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,
    But that I did proceed upon just grounds
    To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.

EMILIA

    My husband!

OTHELLO

    Thy husband.

EMILIA

    That she was false to wedlock?

OTHELLO

    Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,
    If heaven would make me such another world
    Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,
    I'ld not have sold her for it.

EMILIA

    My husband!

OTHELLO

    Ay, 'twas he that told me first:
    An honest man he is, and hates the slime
    That sticks on filthy deeds.

EMILIA

    My husband!

OTHELLO

    What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.

EMILIA

    O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,
    My husband say that she was false!

OTHELLO

    He, woman;
    I say thy husband: dost understand the word?
    My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.

EMILIA

    If he say so, may his pernicious soul
    Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:
    She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.

OTHELLO

    Ha!

EMILIA

    Do thy worst:
    This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
    Than thou wast worthy her.

OTHELLO

    Peace, you were best.

EMILIA

    Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
    As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
    As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--
    I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,
    Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help!
    The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!

    [[Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, and others]]

MONTANO

    What is the matter? How now, general!

EMILIA

    O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,
    That men must lay their murders on your neck.

GRATIANO

    What is the matter?

EMILIA

    Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:
    He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:
    I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:
    Speak, for my heart is full.

IAGO

    I told him what I thought, and told no more
    Than what he found himself was apt and true.

EMILIA

    But did you ever tell him she was false?

IAGO

    I did.

EMILIA

    You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
    Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
    She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio?

IAGO

    With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.

EMILIA

    I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:
    My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,--

All

    O heavens forfend!

EMILIA

    And your reports have set the murder on.

OTHELLO

    Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed.

GRATIANO

    'Tis a strange truth.

MONTANO

    O monstrous act!

EMILIA

    Villany, villany, villany!
    I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!--
    I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--
    O villany, villany!

IAGO

    What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.

EMILIA

    Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:
    'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
    Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.

OTHELLO

    O! O! O!

    [[He falls on the bed]]

EMILIA

    Nay, lay thee down and roar;
    For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
    That e'er did lift up eye.

OTHELLO

    [Rising] O, she was foul!
    I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,
    Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:
    I know this act shows horrible and grim.

GRATIANO

    Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:
    Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
    Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,
    This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
    Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
    And fall to reprobation.

OTHELLO

    'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows
    That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
    A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:
    And she did gratify his amorous works
    With that recognizance and pledge of love
    Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:
    It was a handkerchief, an antique token
    My father gave my mother.

EMILIA

    O heaven! O heavenly powers!

IAGO

    Come, hold your peace.

EMILIA

    'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!
    No, I will speak as liberal as the north:
    Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,
    All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.

IAGO

    Be wise, and get you home.

EMILIA

    I will not.

    [[IAGO offers to stab EMILIA]]

GRATIANO

    Fie!
    Your sword upon a woman?

EMILIA

    O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of
    I found by fortune and did give my husband;
    For often, with a solemn earnestness,
    More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,
    He begg'd of me to steal it.

IAGO

    Villanous whore!

EMILIA

    She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,
    And I did give't my husband.

IAGO

    Filth, thou liest!

EMILIA

    By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
    O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool
    Do with so good a woman?

OTHELLO

    Are there no stones in heaven
    But what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain!

    He runs at IAGO IAGO, from behind, stabs EMILIA, and exit

GRATIANO

    The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.

EMILIA

    Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.

GRATIANO

    He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.

MONTANO

    'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,
    Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:
    Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,
    But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,
    For 'tis a damned slave.

    [[Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO]]

OTHELLO

    I am not valiant neither,
    But ever puny whipster gets my sword:
    But why should honour outlive honesty?
    Let it go all.

EMILIA

    What did thy song bode, lady?
    Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
    And die in music.

    [[Singing]]
    Willow, willow, willow,--
    Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;
    So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;
    So speaking as I think, I die, I die.

    [[Dies]]

OTHELLO

    I have another weapon in this chamber;
    It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:--
    O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.

GRATIANO

    [Within] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:
    Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.

OTHELLO

    Look in upon me then and speak with me,
    Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.

    [[Re-enter GRATIANO]]

GRATIANO

    What is the matter?

OTHELLO

    Behold, I have a weapon;
    A better never did itself sustain
    Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,
    That, with this little arm and this good sword,
    I have made my way through more impediments
    Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!
    Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.
    Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
    Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
    And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
    Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;
    Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
    And he retires. Where should Othello go?
    Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
    Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,
    This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
    And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!
    Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
    Whip me, ye devils,
    From the possession of this heavenly sight!
    Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!
    Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
    O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!
    Oh! Oh! Oh!

    [[Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair, and Officers with IAGO, prisoner]]

LODOVICO

    Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?

OTHELLO

    That's he that was Othello: here I am.

LODOVICO

    Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.

OTHELLO

    I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
    If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.

    [[Wounds IAGO]]

LODOVICO

    Wrench his sword from him.

IAGO

    I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.

OTHELLO

    I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;
    For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.

LODOVICO

    O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,
    Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,
    What shall be said to thee?

OTHELLO

    Why, any thing:
    An honourable murderer, if you will;
    For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.

LODOVICO

    This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:
    Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?

OTHELLO

    Ay.

CASSIO

    Dear general, I never gave you cause.

OTHELLO

    I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
    Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil
    Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?

IAGO

    Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
    From this time forth I never will speak word.

LODOVICO

    What, not to pray?

GRATIANO

    Torments will ope your lips.

OTHELLO

    Well, thou dost best.

LODOVICO

    Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,
    Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter
    Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;
    And here another: the one of them imports
    The death of Cassio to be undertook
    By Roderigo.

OTHELLO

    O villain!

CASSIO

    Most heathenish and most gross!

LODOVICO

    Now here's another discontented paper,
    Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,
    Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;
    But that belike Iago in the interim
    Came in and satisfied him.

OTHELLO

    O the pernicious caitiff!
    How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief
    That was my wife's?

CASSIO

    I found it in my chamber:
    And he himself confess'd but even now
    That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
    Which wrought to his desire.

OTHELLO

    O fool! fool! fool!

CASSIO

    There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
    How he upbraids Iago, that he made him
    Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came
    That I was cast: and even but now he spake,
    After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
    Iago set him on.

LODOVICO

    You must forsake this room, and go with us:
    Your power and your command is taken off,
    And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,
    If there be any cunning cruelty
    That can torment him much and hold him long,
    It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,
    Till that the nature of your fault be known
    To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.

OTHELLO

    Soft you; a word or two before you go.
    I have done the state some service, and they know't.
    No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
    When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
    Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
    Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak
    Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
    Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought
    Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
    Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
    Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,
    Albeit unused to the melting mood,
    Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
    Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;
    And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
    Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
    Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,
    I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
    And smote him, thus.

    [[Stabs himself]]

LODOVICO

    O bloody period!

GRATIANO

    All that's spoke is marr'd.

OTHELLO

    I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;
    Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.

    [[Falls on the bed, and dies]]

CASSIO

    This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;
    For he was great of heart.

LODOVICO

    [To IAGO] O Spartan dog,
    More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!
    Look on the tragic loading of this bed;
    This is thy work: the object poisons sight;
    Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,
    And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,
    For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,
    Remains the censure of this hellish villain;
    The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!
    Myself will straight aboard: and to the state
    This heavy act with heavy heart relate.

    [[Exeunt]]
