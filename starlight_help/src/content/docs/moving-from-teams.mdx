If you're moving from other communication tools, check out the [general
guide on moving to Zulip](/help/moving-to-zulip).

The following steps are described in more detail below:

<Steps>
  1. [Import or create your organization](#import-or-create-your-organization).
  1. [Sign up for a plan](#sign-up-for-a-plan).
  1. [Configure your organization](#configure-your-organization).
  1. [Review and update communication
     policies](#review-and-update-communication-policies).
  1. [Prepare users for the transition](#prepare-users-for-the-transition).
  1. [Invite users to join](#invite-users-to-join).
</Steps>

Each organization is unique, but we hope these common practices will help you
think through the transition process in your own context.

## Import or create your organization

<CreateOrgNoImport />

## Sign up for a plan

<SignUpForAPlan />

## Configure your organization

<FlattenedSteps>
  <ConfigureYourOrganization />

  1. [Create channels](/help/create-channels). Zulip's
     [topics](/help/introduction-to-topics) give each conversation its own
     space, so one channel per team should be enough to get you started.
  1. Take advantage of Zulip's [native integrations ecosystem](/integrations) by
     connecting Zulip with the tools you use.

## Review and update communication policies

  <CommunicationPoliciesList />

  * In Zulip, it's easy to have many conversations in parallel without losing
    track of anything. Consider adjusting your communication guidelines to
    recommend having substantive discussions in channels, with less reliance on
    DMs.
  * Zulip allows users to fine-tune their notification settings. Make sure you're
    happy with the [defaults](/help/configure-default-new-user-settings) for your
    organization, and encourage users to adjust from there.
  * Zulip makes it easy to find conversations and follow up. To avoid disrupting
    focus work, @-mentions in Zulip should generally be reserved for
    time-sensitive messages. [Silent
    mentions](/help/mention-a-user-or-group#silently-mention-a-user) make it easy
    to refer to someone without calling for their attention.

## Prepare users for the transition

Prepare an introduction to Zulip for your organization. It often works well to
combine a written announcement with a live presentation. Recommended topics to
cover include:

  <PrepareForTransition1 />

  1. Pointers to additional resources, such as Zulip's [getting started
     guide](/help/getting-started-with-zulip).

team.
