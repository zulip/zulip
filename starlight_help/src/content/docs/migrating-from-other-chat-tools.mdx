import ZulipNote from "../../components/ZulipNote.astro";

If your organization is moving to Zulip from another chat tool, you can use
Zulip's tools to import your data, including users, channels, messages, and
more. Follow these guides:

* [Moving from Slack](/help/moving-from-slack). You can [import your Slack
  workspace](/help/import-from-slack). Zulip's [Slack-compatible incoming
  webhook](https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/slack_incoming) also makes it easy
  to migrate any integrations.
* [Import from Mattermost](/help/import-from-mattermost)
* [Import from Rocket.Chat](/help/import-from-rocketchat)

<ZulipNote>
  **You can only import a workspace as a new Zulip organization.** Your imported
  message history cannot be added into an existing Zulip organization.
