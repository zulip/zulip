Organization administrators can configure the default values of
personal preference settings for new users joining the
organization. This can help seamlessly customize the Zulip experience
to match how the organization in question is using Zulip.

Existing users' preferences cannot be modified by administrators, and
users will be able to customize their own settings once they
join. Administrators can customize defaults for all personal
preference settings, including the following:

* Privacy settings:
  * Displaying [availability](/help/status-and-availability) to other users
  * Allowing others to see when the user has [read
    messages](/help/read-receipts)
  * Allowing others to see when the user is [typing a
    message](/help/typing-notifications)
* Preferences:
  * [Language](/help/change-your-language)
  * [Time format](/help/change-the-time-format)
  * [Light theme vs. dark theme](/help/dark-theme)
  * [Font size](/help/font-size)
  * [Line spacing](/help/line-spacing)
  * [Emoji theme](/help/emoji-and-emoticons#change-your-emoji-set)
  * [Home view](/help/configure-home-view)
    ([**Inbox**](/help/inbox) vs.
    [**Recent conversations**](/help/recent-conversations) vs.
    [**Combined feed**](/help/reading-strategies#combined-feed))
* Notification settings:
  * What types of messages [trigger notifications][default-notifications]
  * Which topics users will [automatically follow](/help/follow-a-topic). This
    minimizes the need to [mention](/help/mention-a-user-or-group) other users
    to get their attention.

## Configure default settings for new users

Users will have the initial settings that are configured at the time when they
accept the invitation, so there's no need to update or revoke invitations when
you change default settings.

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/default-user-settings" />

  1. Review all settings and adjust as needed.
</FlattenedSteps>

## Configure default language for new users

Your organization's [language](/help/configure-organization-language) will be
the default language for new users when Zulip cannot detect their language
preferences from their browser, including all users [created via the Zulip
API](/api/create-user).

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/organization-settings" />

  1. Under **Automated messages and emails**, change the **Language for
     automated messages and invitation emails**.

  <SaveChanges />
