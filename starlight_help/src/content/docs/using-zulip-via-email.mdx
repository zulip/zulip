With Zulip, it is possible for some members of your organization to participate
from their email client, without opening the Zulip app after the initial
setup is complete.

## Subscribe a Zulip channel to a mailing list

<Steps>
  1. Create a mailing list to use with Zulip, or use an existing one.
  1. Create a Zulip channel that will receive mailing list traffic, or
     use an existing one.
  1. [Generate an email
     address](/help/message-a-channel-by-email#message-a-channel-by-email_1) for
     the channel you created.
  1. Add the email address for the channel to the mailing list.
</Steps>

New emails sent to the email list will now be mirrored to the channel.

## Setup instructions for email users

If you want to interact with Zulip primarily (or entirely) via your email client:

<FlattenedSteps>
  1. [Subscribe](/help/introduction-to-channels#browse-and-subscribe-to-channels) to any channels you are
     interested in.

  <NavigationSteps target="settings/notifications" />

  1. In the **Notification triggers** table, make sure both of the checkboxes
     under **Email** are checked.
  1. Close the Zulip window. Zulip does not send email notifications
     while you are actively engaging with the web application.
</FlattenedSteps>

New Zulip messages will now be delivered to your email account. You
can reply directly to the emails coming from Zulip, and your replies
will be posted in the appropriate topic or direct message
conversation on Zulip.
