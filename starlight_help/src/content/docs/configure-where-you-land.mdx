title: Configure where you land in message feeds

import {TabItem, Tabs} from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

import FlattenedSteps from "../../components/FlattenedSteps.astro";
import MobileSettings from "../include/_MobileSettings.mdx";

When you go to a message feed in the Zulip web or desktop app, you'll generally
land at your oldest unread message in that view.
[Searches](/help/search-for-messages) and [starred
messages](/help/star-a-message) put you at the newest message instead.

In the mobile app, you can choose where message feeds will open:

* **First unread message**: Recommended if you like to clear your inbox of
  unread messages.
* **First unread message in conversation views, newest message elsewhere**: In
  Zulip, a **conversation** is a [direct message](/help/direct-messages) thread
  (one-on-one or with a group), or a [topic in a
  channel](/help/introduction-to-topics). This option works well if you have old
  unread messages, and don't want to navigate there in your [Combined
  feed](/help/combined-feed) and [channel feeds](/help/channel-feed).
* **Newest message**: You may be used to this behavior from other chat
  applications. To avoid accidentally marking messages as read,
  consider setting [Mark messages as read on
  scroll](/help/marking-messages-as-read#configure-whether-messages-are-automatically-marked-as-read)
  to **Never** when using this setting.
