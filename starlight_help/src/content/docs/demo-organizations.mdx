## Configure an email for your account

To take certain administrative actions, like [inviting other
users](/help/invite-new-users) or converting a demo organization to a permanent
organization, you'll need to configure an email for your account.

     information. Click **Add**.
  1. You will receive a confirmation email within a few minutes. Open
     it and click **Confirm and set password**.

## Convert a demo organization to a permanent organization

<OwnerOnly />

If you'd like to keep your demo organization's message history and user
accounts, you can convert it to a permanent Zulip organization. You'll be able
to choose a new subdomain for your organization's URL.

Everyone will be logged out of existing sessions on the web, mobile and desktop
apps, and will need to log in again at the new URL. Any [API clients](/api/) or
[integrations](/integrations/) will need to be updated to point to the new
organization URL.

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/organization-profile" />

  1. Click the **Convert** button in the banner at the top.
  1. Enter your new **Organization URL**, and click **Convert**.
</FlattenedSteps>

## Deactivate a demo organization

<OwnerOnly />

Demo organizations are automatically deactivated after 30 days, but you can
also manually deactivate your organization.

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/organization-profile" />

  1. Under **Deactivate organization**, click **Deactivate organization**.
  1. Select when the organization's data (users, channels, messages, etc.)
     should be permanently deleted. If you haven't configured an email for your
     account, data will be deleted immediately.
  1. Approve by clicking **Confirm**.
