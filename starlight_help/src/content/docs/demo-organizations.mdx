  **Note:** The ability to create demo organizations is an upcoming
  feature. It is not available yet.
</ZulipNote>

If you would like to try out Zulip without having to make any
decisions (like how to name your organization or whether to import
data from an existing chat tool), you can create a Zulip demo
organization.

Demo organizations differ from a regular Zulip organization in a few
ways:

* A demo organization will be automatically deleted 30 days after
  creation. You can [convert a demo organization into a regular
  organization](#convert-a-demo-organization-to-a-permanent-organization)
  if you'd prefer to keep its history.
* You do not need to choose a URL or when creating a demo organization;
  one will be generated automatically for you.
* A demo organization cannot be directly upgraded to a paid Zulip
  Cloud plan without first converting to a regular organization.

Other than those limitations, they work exactly like a normal Zulip
organization; you can invite additional users, connect the mobile
apps, etc.

## Create a demo organization

<Steps>
  1. Go to zulip.com and click **New organization** in the top-right corner.
</Steps>

## Configure an email for your account

To take certain administrative actions, like [inviting other
users](/help/invite-new-users) or converting a demo organization to a permanent
organization, you'll need to configure an email for your account.

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/account-and-privacy" />

  1. Under **Account**, click **Add email**, and fill out the required
     information. Click **Add**.
  1. You will receive a confirmation email within a few minutes. Open
     it and click **Confirm and set password**.
  1. Configure a password, and click **Submit**.
</FlattenedSteps>

## Convert a demo organization to a permanent organization

<OwnerOnly />

If you'd like to keep your demo organization's message history and user
accounts, you can convert it to a permanent Zulip organization. You'll be able
to choose a new subdomain for your organization's URL.

Everyone will be logged out of existing sessions on the web, mobile and desktop
apps, and will need to log in again at the new URL. Any [API clients](/api/) or
[integrations](/integrations/) will need to be updated to point to the new
organization URL.

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/organization-profile" />

  1. Click the **Convert** button in the banner at the top.
  1. Enter your new **Organization URL**, and click **Convert**.
</FlattenedSteps>

## Deactivate a demo organization

<OwnerOnly />

Demo organizations are automatically deactivated after 30 days, but you can
also manually deactivate your organization.

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/organization-profile" />

  1. Under **Deactivate organization**, click **Deactivate organization**.
  1. Select when the organization's data (users, channels, messages, etc.)
     should be permanently deleted. If you haven't configured an email for your
     account, data will be deleted immediately.
  1. Approve by clicking **Confirm**.
