<ZulipNote>
  On self-hosted servers, this feature need to be
  [configured][configure-gifs] by a server administrator.
</ZulipNote>

Zulip integrates with [GIPHY](https://giphy.com) and [Tenor](https://tenor.com/), allowing you to
conveniently search for animated GIFs and include them in your
messages.

Organization administrators can [disable previews of linked
images](/help/image-video-and-website-previews#configure-whether-image-and-video-previews-are-shown),
including GIFs. When previews are enabled, everyone can
[customize](/help/image-video-and-website-previews#configure-how-animated-images-are-played)
how animated images are played.

## Insert a GIF

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <Steps>
      1. Click the **add GIF** (<GifIcon />) icon at
         the bottom of the compose box.
      1. Find a GIF you'd like to use.
      1. Click on an image to insert it in the compose box.
    </Steps>

    <ZulipTip>
      You can [preview your message](/help/preview-your-message-before-sending)
      before sending.
    </ZulipTip>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Restrict maximum rating of GIFs retrieved

<AdminOnly />

By default, the GIPHY and Tenor integrations are configured to only retrieve GIFs
that they categorize as rated G (General audience). You can change
this rating configuration or disable your GIF integration entirely:

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/organization-settings" />

  1. Under **Compose settings**, select a rating for **GIF integration**.

  <SaveChanges />
</FlattenedSteps>

## Privacy

Zulip’s GIF picker supports third-party services, currently GIPHY
and Tenor. Any text you enter into the GIF search box will be
sent from your browser directly to the corresponding service’s API.
Because these requests are made client-side, the service you are
querying (GIPHY or Tenor) will be able to see your IP address
and may use that data for tracking, similar to if you visited their
website and performed the same search there.

Zulip proxies all external images in messages through the server,
including those from GIPHY and Tenor, to prevent images from being used to track
recipients of GIFs from both the integrations.
