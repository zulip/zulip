You can configure who can subscribe other users to channels. If you have
permission to subscribe users [to a specific
channel](#configure-who-can-subscribe-anyone-to-a-specific-channel), you can
always do so, whether or not you're subscribed yourself.

There is also a [general
permission](#configure-who-can-subscribe-others-to-channels-in-general), which
allows subscribing others to all [public
channels](/help/channel-permissions#public-channels). For [private
channels](/help/channel-permissions#private-channels), you additionally need to
have content access to the channel in order to use this permission. Users have
content access if:

<ContentAccessDefinition />

[Guests](/help/guest-users) are never permitted to subscribe others.

## Configure who can subscribe anyone to a specific channel

If you have permission to administer a public channel, you can configure who can
