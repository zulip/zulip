</ZulipNote>

Zulip has high quality export tools that can be used to migrate between the
hosted Zulip Cloud service and your own servers. Zulip offers the following
options for exporting data in an importable format:

* [**Public data
  only**](#export-data-in-an-importable-format):
  Complete data for your organization *other than* [private
  channel](/help/channel-permissions#private-channels) messages and [direct
  messages](/help/direct-messages). This export includes user settings and
  channel subscriptions.
* [**Public and private data (with
  consent)**](#export-data-in-an-importable-format):
  Everything in the export of public data, plus all the [private
  channel](/help/channel-permissions#private-channels) messages and [direct
  messages](/help/direct-messages) that members who have
  [allowed](#configure-whether-administrators-can-export-your-private-data)
  administrators to export their private data can access.
* [**All public and private data**](#export-of-all-public-and-private-data).
  This option is only available to **corporate** [Zulip Cloud Standard][plans]
  and [Zulip Cloud Plus][plans] customers.

In addition, [Zulip Cloud Standard][plans] and [Zulip Cloud Plus][plans]
customers can request a compliance export:

* [**Compliance export**](#compliance-export): A targeted, human-readable export
  of messages matching some combination of criteria (e.g., sender, recipient,
  message keyword, or timestamp).

## Export data in an importable format

<AdminOnly />

<NotHumanExportFormat />

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <NavigationSteps target="settings/data-exports-admin" />

      1. Click **Start export**.
      1. Select the desired **Export type**.
      1. Click **Start export** to begin the export process. After a few minutes,
         you'll be able to download the exported data from the list of
         data exports.
      1. Use [Zulip's logical data import tool][import-only] to import your data into
         a self-hosted server. For Zulip Cloud imports, contact
         [support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com).
    </FlattenedSteps>

    <ZulipNote>
      Generating the export can take up to an hour for organizations
      with a large number of messages or uploaded files.
    </ZulipNote>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Export of all public and private data

<OwnerOnly />

<ExportAllPublicAndPrivateDataRequirements />

Contact [support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com) to request access to this export
type, then follow the export instructions above.

If you self-host Zulip, an export of all public and private data can be performed
[by your server's administrator][export-and-import].

## Compliance export

<OwnerOnly />

This type of export is recommended if you plan to work with the exported data
directly (e.g., reading messages or processing them with a script), rather than
importing the export into a new Zulip organization.

<ExportAllPublicAndPrivateDataRequirements />

<Steps>
  1. Email [support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com) asking for a **compliance
     export**. Please send the email from the same address that you use to sign in
     to Zulip, so that Zulip Support can verify that you are an owner of the
     organization. You will need to specify:
     1. The `zulipchat.com` URL for your organization
     1. What limits you would like on the export.  Currently, compliance
        exports can apply any combination of the following filters:
        * Message sender
        * Message recipient
        * Message contents, by specific keywords
        * Sent timestamp before, after, or between dates
          If you need other limits, please ask.
     1. Your preferred format for the export: CSV or JSON.
     1. Whether or not you want to receive copies of all attachments referenced in
        the exported messages.
  1. You will receive the requested information once your authority to request the
     export has been verified.
</Steps>

If you self-host Zulip, a compliance export can be performed [by your server's
administrator][compliance-exports-self-hosted].

## Configure whether administrators can export your private data

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/account-and-privacy" />
