Welcome to Zulip! This page will guide you through the process of transitioning
your organization to Zulip. It assumes that you have [completed your initial
evaluation](/help/trying-out-zulip) of Zulip, decided [whether to use Zulip
Cloud or self-host](/help/zulip-cloud-or-self-hosting), and are ready to
introduce Zulip to your organization.

The following steps are described in more detail below:

<Steps>
  1. [Create your organization](#create-your-organization).
  1. [Sign up for a plan](#sign-up-for-a-plan).
  1. [Configure your organization](#configure-your-organization).
  1. [Review and update communication policies](#review-and-update-communication-policies).
  1. [Prepare users for the transition](#prepare-users-for-the-transition).
  1. [Invite users to join](#invite-users-to-join).
</Steps>

Each organization is unique, but we hope these common practices will help you
think through the transition process in your own context.

## Create your organization

You can create a new Zulip Cloud organization in less than two minutes. Setting
up a self-hosted server will take a bit longer, but is easy to do with Zulip's
[robust
installer](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html).

Zulip has import tools for [Slack](/help/import-from-slack),
[Mattermost](/help/import-from-mattermost) and
[Rocket.Chat](/help/import-from-rocketchat). You can import your organization's
chat data, including message history, users, channels, and custom emoji. To
inquire about importing data from another product, [contact Zulip
support](/help/contact-support).

Data is imported into Zulip as a new organization, so the best time to import is
when your team is about to start using Zulip for day-to-day work. This may be
part of your evaluation process, or after you've made the decision to move to
Zulip.

    <Steps>
      1. If you plan to self-host, [set up your Zulip
         server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html). You
         can self-host Zulip directly on Ubuntu or Debian Linux, in
         [Docker](https://github.com/zulip/docker-zulip), or with prebuilt images for
         [Digital Ocean](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/zulip) and
         [Render](https://render.com/docs/deploy-zulip).
      1. Create a Zulip organization [on Zulip Cloud](https://zulip.com/new/) or [on
         your self-hosted
         server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html#step-3-create-a-zulip-organization-and-log-in).

## Sign up for a plan

If you require features that are not available on [Zulip Cloud
Free](https://zulip.com/plans/#cloud) or the [Zulip
Free](https://zulip.com/plans/#self-hosted) plan for self-hosted organizations,
you will need to upgrade your plan.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Zulip Cloud">
    <Steps>
      1. Follow the
         [instructions](/help/zulip-cloud-billing#upgrade-to-a-zulip-cloud-standard-or-plus-plan)
         to upgrade to a Zulip Cloud Standard or Plus plan. If your organization may
         be
         [eligible](/help/zulip-cloud-billing#free-and-discounted-zulip-cloud-standard)
         for a free or discounted plan, you can [apply for
         sponsorship](/help/zulip-cloud-billing#apply-for-sponsorship).
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Self hosting">
    <Steps>
      1. Follow the [instructions](/help/self-hosted-billing#upgrade-to-a-paid-plan)
         to upgrade to a Zulip Basic or Zulip Business plan. If your organization may
         be [eligible](/help/self-hosted-billing#free-community-plan) for a free or
         discounted plan, you can [apply for
         sponsorship](/help/self-hosted-billing#apply-for-community-plan). To inquire
         about Zulip Enterprise, please reach out to
         [sales@zulip.com](mailto:sales@zulip.com).
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configure your organization

<Steps>
  1. [Create your organization profile](/help/create-your-organization-profile),
     which is displayed on your organization's registration and login pages.
  1. [Create user groups](/help/create-user-groups), which offer a flexible way to
     manage permissions.
  1. Review [organization permissions](/help/manage-permissions), such as who
     can invite users, create channels, etc.
  1. If your organization uses an issue tracker (e.g., GitHub, Salesforce,
     Zendesk, Jira, etc.), configure [linkifiers](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier) to
     automatically turn issue numbers (e.g., #2468) into links.
  1. Set up [custom profile fields](/help/custom-profile-fields), which make it
     easy for users to share information, such as their pronouns, job title, or
     team.
  1. Review [default user settings](/help/configure-default-new-user-settings),
     including language, [default visibility for email
     addresses](/help/configure-email-visibility), and notification preferences.
  1. [Create channels](/help/create-channels), unless you've imported
     channels from another app. Zulip's [topics](/help/introduction-to-topics)
     give each conversation its own space, so one channel per team should be
     enough to get you started.
  1. [Set up integrations](/help/set-up-integrations) so that your
     team can experience all their regular workflows inside the Zulip app. Zulip's
     [Slack-compatible incoming
     webhook](https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/slack_incoming) makes it easy to
     move your integrations when migrating an organization from Slack to Zulip.
</Steps>

## Review and update communication policies

Consider updating your organization's communication policies and best
practice recommendations to take advantage of Zulip's organized
conversations:

* Many organizations find that with Zulip, there’s no longer a reason to use
  email for internal communications. You get the organization of an email
  [inbox](/help/inbox) together with all the features of a modern chat app,
  like instant delivery of messages, emoji reactions, typing notifications,
  @-mentions, and more.
* Because Zulip further organizes messages into conversations labeled with
  [topics](/help/introduction-to-topics), there is generally no need to create
  dedicated channels for specific projects.
* With conversations organized by topic, you can review prior discussions to
  understand past work, explanations, and decisions — your chat history
  becomes a knowledge base. Should it be standard practice to link to Zulip
  conversations from docs, issue trackers, etc. for additional context?
* Using Zulip, you can discuss complex topics and make decisions with input
  from all stakeholders, without the overhead of scheduling meeting. Are
  there standing meetings you might not need? For example, stand-ups can be
  replaced with dedicated check-in topics for each team member.

## Prepare users for the transition

Prepare an introduction to Zulip for your organization. It's often effective to
combine a written announcement with a live presentation. Recommended topics to
cover include:

<Steps>
  1. Brief introduction to Zulip.
  1. Why you're making this change. How do you expect it to improve communication
     in your organization?
  1. Accompanying changes to your communication policies. Are there any changes
     to common workflows?
  1. Pointers to additional resources, such as Zulip's [getting started
     guide](/help/getting-started-with-zulip).
  1. Transition timeline.
  1. How users will be supported during the transition.
</Steps>
