## Managing muted channels

Zulip works best when most of the messages you receive are not muted. If you
find yourself muting a lot of channels, consider
[unsubscribing](/help/unsubscribe-from-a-channel) from public channels you've
muted. You can always
[re-subscribe](/help/introduction-to-channels#browse-and-subscribe-to-channels)
if you need to, [view the channel
feed](/help/channel-feed#go-to-channel-feed-for-an-unsubscribed-channel) without
subscribing, or search for messages [in all public
channels](/help/search-for-messages#search-by-location).
