Outgoing webhooks allow you to build or set up Zulip integrations
which are notified when certain types of messages are sent in Zulip.
When one of those events is [triggered](#triggering), the Zulip server
will send an HTTP POST [payload](/api/outgoing-webhook-payload) to the
webhook's configured URL.

Outgoing webhooks can be used to power a wide range of Zulip
integrations. For example, the [Zulip Botserver](/help/deploying-bots#zulip-botserver)
is built on top of this API.

## Create an outgoing webhook bot user

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <NavigationSteps target="settings/your-bots" />

      1. Click **Add a new bot**.
      1. Set **Bot type** to **Outgoing webhook**.
      1. Fill out the fields, with **Endpoint URL** set to the URL you'd like
         Zulip to post to, and the outgoing webhook [format](/api/outgoing-webhook-payload)
         you plan on using.
      1. Click **Add**.
    </FlattenedSteps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Triggering

There are currently two ways to trigger an outgoing webhook:

* **@-mention** the bot user in a channel.  If the bot
  [replies](#replying-with-a-message), its reply will be sent to that
  channel and topic.
* **Send a direct message** with the bot user as one of the recipients.
  If the bot [replies](#replying-with-a-message), its reply will be
  sent to that direct message conversation.

## Timeouts

The remote server must respond to a `POST` request in a timely manner.
The default timeout for outgoing webhooks is 10 seconds, though this
can be configured by the administrator of the Zulip server by setting
`OUTGOING_WEBHOOKS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` in the [server's
settings](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/settings.html#server-settings).

## Replying with a message

Many bots implemented using this outgoing webhook API will want to
send a reply message into Zulip.  Zulip's outgoing webhook API
provides a convenient way to do that by simply returning an
appropriate HTTP response to the Zulip server.

A correctly implemented bot will return a JSON object containing one
of two possible formats, described below.

### Example response payloads

If the bot code wants to opt out of responding, it can explicitly
encode a JSON dictionary that contains `response_not_required` set
to `True`, so that no response message is sent to the user.  (This
is helpful to distinguish deliberate non-responses from bugs.)

Here's an example of the JSON your server should respond with if
you would not like to send a response message:

```json
{
    "response_not_required": true
}
```

Here's an example of the JSON your server should respond with if
you would like to send a response message:

```json
{
    "content": "Hey, we just received **something** from Zulip!"
}
```

The `content` field should contain [Zulip-flavored Markdown](/help/format-your-message-using-markdown).

Note that an outgoing webhook bot can use the [Zulip REST
API](/api/rest) with its API key in case your bot needs to do
something else, like add an emoji reaction or upload a file.
