Zulip uses the time zone configured on your computer or mobile device for
displaying dates and times, such as when a message was sent.

You can [configure your **local time**](#configure-your-local-time) as it's
shown to other users in your [user card](/help/user-cards) and
[profile](/help/view-someones-profile). When your local time doesn't match your
computer's time zone, the Zulip web and desktop apps display a banner offering
to update it. If you don't want to see this banner, you can [hide
it](#hide-banner-when-time-zones-dont-match).

## Configure your local time

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <NavigationSteps target="settings/profile" />

      1. Under **Profile**, select a time zone.
    </FlattenedSteps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Hide banner when time zones don't match

If you local time in Zulip differs from your device's time zone (for example,
you changed your computer's time zone while traveling), you'll see a banner in
the web and desktop apps offering to update your local time to match your
computer's current time zone.

You can choose to permanently hide this banner.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <NavigationSteps target="settings/profile" />

      1. Under **Profile**, toggle **Offer to update to my computer's
         time zone**.
    </FlattenedSteps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
