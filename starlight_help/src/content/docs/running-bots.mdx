Zulip's API has a powerful framework for interactive bots that react to messages
in Zulip. You can [write your own interactive bot](/help/writing-bots), or run an
existing [Zulip bot](https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip-api/tree/main/zulip_bots/zulip_bots/bots).

## Running a bot

This guide will show you how to run an existing
[Zulip bot](https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip-api/tree/main/zulip_bots/zulip_bots/bots).

<ZulipNote>
  Please be considerate when testing experimental bots on public servers such as chat.zulip.org.
</ZulipNote>

You'll need:

* An account in a Zulip organization
  (e.g., [the Zulip development community](https://zulip.com/development-community/),
  `{{ display_host }}`, or a Zulip organization on your own
  [development](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/overview.html) or
  [production](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/install.html) server).
* A computer where you're running the bot from.

<FlattenedSteps>
  1. [Create a bot](/help/add-a-bot-or-integration), making sure to select
     **Generic bot** as the **Bot type**.

  1. [Download the bot's `zuliprc` file](/api/configuring-python-bindings#download-a-zuliprc-file).

  1. Use the following command to install the
     [`zulip_bots` Python package](https://pypi.org/project/zulip-bots/):

  ```
   pip3 install zulip_bots
  ```

  1. Use the following command to start the bot process *(replacing
     `~/path/to/zuliprc` with the path to the `zuliprc` file you downloaded above)*:

     ```
     zulip-run-bot <bot-name> --config-file ~/path/to/zuliprc
     ```

  1. Check the output of the command above to make sure your bot is running.
     It should include the following line:

     ```
     INFO:root:starting message handling...
     ```

  1. Test your setup by [starting a new direct message](/help/starting-a-new-direct-message)
     with the bot or [mentioning](/help/mention-a-user-or-group) the bot on a channel.

<ZulipNote>
  To use the latest development version of the `zulip_bots` package, follow
  [these steps](/help/writing-bots#installing-a-development-version-of-the-zulip-bots-package).
</ZulipNote>

You can now play around with the bot and get it configured the way you
like.  Eventually, you'll probably want to run it in a production
environment where it'll stay up, by [deploying](/help/deploying-bots) it on a
server using the Zulip Botserver.
