To avoid clutter in the [left sidebar](/help/left-sidebar), Zulip automatically
hides channels with no recent messages if you're subscribed to 20+ channels. You
can [configure](#configure-hiding-inactive-channels) Zulip to show or hide
inactive channels regardless of how many you're subscribed to.

It's easy to [reveal](#reveal-or-hide-inactive-channels) or
[find](#find-inactive-channels) hidden inactive channels if you need to access
them.

## Reveal or hide inactive channels

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <Steps>
      1. In the left sidebar, scroll to the bottom of the list of channels in the
         [folder](/help/channel-folders) you're viewing.
      1. Click **inactive or muted** or **inactive** to toggle whether inactive
         channels are hidden. If you don't see this button, there are no
         inactive channels, or inactive channels are
         [configured](#configure-hiding-inactive-channels) to always be shown.
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
