Each user can use Zulip with [their preferred language][user-lang].
Additionally, if your organization has a primary language other than
American English, you can set the language used for the organization's
automated messages and invitation emails. This setting:

* Determines the language used for [automated
  notices](/help/configure-automated-notices) that are sent to channels, including
  both the topic name and message content. (Automated messages sent to a single
  user will use that user's preferred language).
* Determines the language used for outgoing
  [invitation emails](/help/invite-new-users).
* Is used as the default language for new user accounts when Zulip
  cannot detect their language preferences from their browser,
  including all users [created via the Zulip API][api-create-user].

## Configure the organization language

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/organization-settings" />

  1. Under **Automated messages and emails**, change the **Language for
     automated messages and invitation emails**.

  <SaveChanges />
