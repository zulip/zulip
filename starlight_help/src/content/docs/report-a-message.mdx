When moderation requests are enabled, you can report problematic messages. This
sends a message to a private channel, where moderators can review the report.

Keep in mind that reporting a message does not grant anyone access to see the
rest of the conversation. For example, moderators will see only direct messages
that you report, not other DMs in the same thread.

## Report a message

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <MessageActions />

      1. Select **report message**. If you do not see this option, moderation requests
         are [disabled](/help/enable-moderation-requests) in this organization.
      1. Fill out the requested information. Moderators will see the message
         you're reporting when they review your report.
      1. Click **Submit** to report the message.
    </FlattenedSteps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
