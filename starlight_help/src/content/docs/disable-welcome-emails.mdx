<AdminOnly />

Zulip sends a handful of emails to new users, introducing them to the Zulip
app, when they join an organization. If these emails don't make sense for
your organization, you can disable them.

Note that regardless of this setting, users will receive an initial account
email notifying them about their new Zulip account and how to log in.

## Disable welcome emails
