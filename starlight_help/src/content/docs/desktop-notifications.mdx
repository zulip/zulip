Zulip can be configured to send visual and audible desktop notifications for
[DMs, mentions, and alerts](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications), as well as
[channel messages](/help/channel-notifications) and [followed
topics](/help/follow-a-topic#configure-notifications-for-followed-topics).

## Unread count badge

By default, Zulip displays a count of your unmuted unread messages on the
[desktop app](https://zulip.com/apps/) sidebar and on the browser tab icon. You
can configure the badge to only count [direct messages](/help/direct-messages)
and [mentions](/help/mention-a-user-or-group), or to include messages in
[followed topics](/help/follow-a-topic) but not other
[channel](/help/introduction-to-channels) messages.

### Configure unread count badge

<FlattenedSteps>
  <NavigationSteps target="settings/notifications" />

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Desktop/Web">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <NavigationSteps target="settings/notifications" />

      1. Under **Desktop message notifications**, click **Send a test notification**.
         If notifications are working, you will receive a test notification.
    </FlattenedSteps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting desktop notifications

Desktop notifications are triggered when a message arrives, and Zulip is not
in focus or the message is offscreen. You must have Zulip open in a browser
tab or in the Zulip desktop app to receive desktop notifications.

**Visual desktop notifications** appear in the corner of your main monitor.
**Audible desktop notifications** make a sound.

To receive notifications in the desktop app, make sure that [Do Not Disturb
mode](/help/do-not-disturb) is turned off.

### Check notification settings for DMs or channels

If you have successfully received a [test
notification](#testing-desktop-notifications), but you aren't seeing desktop
notifications for new messages, check your Zulip notification settings. Make
sure you have enabled desktop notifications [for
DMs](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) or [for the
channel](/help/channel-notifications) you are testing. Messages in [muted
topics](/help/mute-a-topic) will not trigger notifications.

### Check platform settings

The most common issue is that your browser or system settings are blocking
notifications from Zulip. Before checking Zulip-specific settings, make sure
that **Do Not Disturb mode** is not enabled on your computer.
