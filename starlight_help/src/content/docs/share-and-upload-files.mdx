Zulip supports attaching multiple files to messages, including images,
documents, sound, and video. You can edit the names of the files others see
after you [upload](#uploading-files) or
[share](#sharing-files-from-other-mobile-apps) them.

For images and videos, a small preview will be shown directly in the message, if
there are up to 24 attachments. People reading the message can click on the
preview to [view the full-size image or video](/help/view-images-and-videos).

## File upload limits

The Zulip Cloud Standard and Zulip Cloud Plus
[plans](https://zulip.com/plans/#cloud) include 5 GB of file storage per user.
Each uploaded file can be up to 1 GB.

The Zulip Cloud Free [plan](https://zulip.com/plans/#cloud) includes a total of
5 GB of file storage. Each uploaded file can be up to 10 MB.

In organizations on a self-hosted server, server administrators can configure
the maximum size for uploaded files via the `MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE`
[server setting][system-settings]. Setting it to 0 disables file uploads, and
hides the UI for uploading files from the web and desktop apps.
