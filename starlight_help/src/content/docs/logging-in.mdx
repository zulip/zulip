By default, Zulip allows logging in via email/password as well as
various social authentication providers like Google, GitHub, GitLab,
and Apple.

Organization administrators can
[add other authentication methods](/help/configure-authentication-methods),
including the SAML and LDAP integrations, or disable any of the methods above.

You can log in with any method allowed by your organization, regardless of
how you signed up. For example, if you originally signed up using your Google
account, you can later log in using GitHub, as long as your Google account
and GitHub account use the same email address.

## Find the Zulip log in URL

Here are some ways to find the URL for your Zulip organization.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="If you are logged out">
    * If your organization is hosted on [Zulip Cloud](https://zulip.com/plans/)
      (usually at `*.zulipchat.com`), go to the [**Find your
      accounts**](https://zulip.com/accounts/find/) page and enter the email address
      that you signed up with. You will receive an email with the sign-in
      information for any Zulip organizations associated with your email address.
    * Search your email account for a registration email from Zulip. The subject
      line will include `Zulip: Your new account details` or `Zulip: Your new
      organization details`. This email provides your organization's log in URL.
    * If you have visited your organization's log in page in the past, try reviewing
      your browser's history. Searching for `zulipchat.com` should find the right
      page if your Zulip organization is hosted on [Zulip
      Cloud](https://zulip.com/plans/).
    * You can ask your organization administrators for your Zulip URL.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="If you are logged in">
    * If using Zulip in the browser, your organization's Zulip log in URL is the first part
      of what you see in the URL bar (e.g., `<organization-name>.zulipchat.com` for
      [Zulip Cloud](https://zulip.com/plans/) organizations).
    * In the Desktop app, select **Copy Zulip URL** from the **Zulip** menu to
      copy the URL of the currently active organization. You can also access the
      **Copy Zulip URL** option by right-clicking on an organization logo in the
      **organizations sidebar** on the left.
    * In the Mobile app, tap your **profile picture** in the bottom right corner of
      the app, then tap **switch account** to see the URLs for all the organizations
      you are logged in to.
    * On [Zulip Cloud](https://zulip.com/plans/) and other Zulip servers updated to
      [Zulip 6.0 or
      higher](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview/changelog.html#zulip-6-x-series),
      click the **gear** (<GearIcon />) icon in the upper right
      corner of the web or desktop app. Your organization's log in URL is shown in the top
      section of the menu.
