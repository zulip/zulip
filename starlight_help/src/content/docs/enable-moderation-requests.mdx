When moderation requests are enabled, users can report problematic messages.
This sends a message to a private channel, where moderators can review the
report. To make it easy to see all reports about someone's behavior and discuss
them, there will be a dedicated topic for each user whose messages are reported.

If no channel for moderation requests is configured, users won't see the option
to report a message.
