Your organization's profile includes its **name**,
[**type**](/help/organization-type), **description**, **profile picture**, and
**logo**. The name, description and profile picture appear on the registration
and login pages for your organization, and (optionally) in the [communities
directory](/help/communities-directory).

* The **organization name** also appears in the title of your Zulip browser tab
  or Desktop app, and in email and desktop notifications. It's best to keep it
  short.
* The **organization type** is used to customize the experience for users
  in your organization, including initial organization settings and
  Welcome Bot messages received by new users.
* The **organization description** supports [full Markdown
  formatting](/help/format-your-message-using-markdown), including
  **bold**/*italic*, links, lists, and more.
* The **organization profile picture** is a square image that is also used for
  [switching between organizations](/help/switching-between-organizations) in
  the desktop app. It will be displayed at 100×100 pixels, or more on
  high-resolution displays.
* The [**organization logo**](#add-a-wide-logo) replaces the Zulip logo in the
  upper left corner of the web and desktop apps.
