SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is a standard
protocol used by Single Sign-On (SSO) services and identity providers
to provision/deprovision user accounts and [groups](/help/user-groups).
Zulip supports SCIM integration, both in Zulip Cloud and for
[self-hosted](/self-hosting/) Zulip servers. This page describes how to
configure SCIM provisioning for Zulip.

<CloudPlusOnly />

<ZulipTip>
  While Zulip's SCIM integration is generic, we've only fully
  documented the setup process with the Okta and Microsoft EntraID
  SCIM providers. [Zulip support](/help/contact-support) is happy to
  help customers configure this integration with SCIM providers that
  do not yet have detailed self-service documentation on this page.

## Configure SCIM

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Okta">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <UpgradeToPlusIfNeeded />

      1. Contact [support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com) to request the
         **Bearer token** that Okta will use to authenticate to your SCIM API.
      1. In your Okta Dashboard, go to **Applications**, and select
         **Browse App Catalog**.
      1. Search for **SCIM** and select **SCIM 2.0 Test App (Header Auth)**.
      1. Click **Add** and choose your **Application label**. For example, you can
         name it "Zulip SCIM".
      1. Continue to **Sign-On Options**. Leave the **SAML** options as they are.
         This type of Okta application doesn't actually support SAML authentication,
         and you'll need to set up a separate Okta app to activate SAML for your Zulip
         organization.
      1. In **Credentials Details**, specify the following fields:
         * **Application username format**: `Email`
         * **Update application username on**: `Create and update`
      1. In the **Provisioning** tab, click **Configure API Integration**, check the
         **Enable API integration** checkbox, and specify the following fields:
         * **Base URL for Zulip Cloud**: `https://your-org.zulipchat.com/scim/v2`
         * **Base URL for self-hosting**: `https://zulip.example.com/scim/v2`
         * **API token**: `Bearer <token>` (given to you by Zulip support)
           When you proceed to the next step, Okta will verify that these details are
           correct by making a SCIM request to the Zulip server.
      1. Enable the following **Provisioning to App** settings:
         * **Create Users**
         * **Update User Attributes**
         * **Deactivate Users**
      1. Remove all attributes in **Attribute Mappings**, *except* for the following:
         * **userName**
         * **givenName**
         * **familyName**
      1. **Optional:** If you'd like to also sync [user role](/help/user-roles),
         you can do it by adding a custom attribute in Okta. Go to the **Profile Editor**,
         click into the entry of the SCIM app you've just set up and **Add Attribute**.
         Configure the following:
         * **Data type**: `string`
         * **Variable name**: `role`
         * **External name**: `role`
         * **External namespace**: `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User`
           With the attribute added, you will now be able to set it for your users directly
           or configure an appropriate **Attribute mapping** in the app's **Provisioning**
           section.
           The valid values are: **owner**, **administrator**, **moderator**, **member**, **guest**.
      1. Now that the integration is ready to manage Zulip user accounts, **assign**
         users to the SCIM app.
         * When you assign a user, Okta will check if the account exists in your
           Zulip organization. If it doesn't, the account will be created.
         * Changes to the user's email or name in Okta will automatically cause the
           Zulip account to be updated accordingly.
         * Unassigning a user from the app will deactivate their Zulip account.

  <TabItem label="Microsoft Entra ID">
    <FlattenedSteps>
      <UpgradeToPlusIfNeeded />

      1. Contact [support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com) to request the
         **Secret Token** that Entra will use to authenticate to your SCIM API.
      1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
      1. Go to **Identity** -> **Applications** -> **Enterprise applications**.
      1. Select **New application** -> **Create your own application**.
      1. Complete the form:
         * Enter a name for your application.
         * Select the option **Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery**.
         * Click **Add** to create the new app. It will be added to your **Enterprise applications**.
      1. Continue to the app's management screen and click **Provisioning** in the left panel.
      1. In the **Provisioning Mode** menu, select **Automatic**  and specify the following fields:
         * **Tenant URL for Zulip Cloud**: `https://your-org.zulipchat.com/scim/v2/?aadOptscim062020`.
         * **Tenant URL for self-hosting**: `https://zulip.example.com/scim/v2/?aadOptscim062020`.
           The `?aadOptscim062020` part of it is a [feature flag][feature-flag]
           that needs to be added to ensure SCIM compliance by Entra ID.
         * **Secret Token**: `<token>` (given to you by Zulip support)
      1. Click **Test Connection.**
      1. In the **Mappings** section, there are two sets of [attribute
         mappings][attribute-mappings]: one for Users and one for
         Groups. Make sure to set **Provision Microsoft Entra ID Groups** to
         be disabled. Provisioning of Groups is currently not supported in
         Zulip.
      1. In **Provision Microsoft Entra ID Users**, configure the necessary mappings:
         * Change **userName** to map to **mail**. **Important**: You need
           **mail** to be set for all your users or trying to assign them
           to the app will fail.
         * Delete the other default entries leaving only the **active** and
           **name.formatted** mappings, until your list looks like the
           image below.
           ![Attribute Mappings](../../images/entraid-scim-mappings.png)
      1. Once your configuration is complete, set the **Provisioning
         Status** to **On** and then click **Save** to start the Microsoft
         Entra provisioning service.
      1. Now you can proceed to the **Users and groups** tab, where you can
         assign users to be provisioned via this integration.
      1. Wait for the initial provisioning cycle to be started by
         Entra. This might take up to 40 minutes. This delay is entirely
         inside Entra, and not under Zulip’s control. You can also use
         [**Provision on demand**][provision-on-demand] in Entra to cause
         immediate SCIM provisioning for specific users, which is handy when
         testing the integration.

## Synchronizing group membership with SCIM

You can enable group sync for any of your SCIM provider's groups. When you do,
the SCIM integration will create a user group in Zulip with the matching name
and user memberships. When you add or remove users from the group in your SCIM
provider, these changes will immediately be reflected in group memberships in
Zulip.

In order to ensure consistent state, do not modify the **name** or **user
memberships** of SCIM-managed groups inside of Zulip. Such groups are meant to
be managed in your SCIM provider. Changes made on the Zulip side will not be
reflected in your SCIM provider, and instead will cause the state of the Zulip
group to become inconsistent with the state of the SCIM provider's group.

Zulip supports [adding user groups to other
groups](/help/manage-user-groups#add-user-groups-to-a-group), but some SCIM
providers (including Okta) do not. As a result, this concept is also not
supported in Zulip's SCIM integration. If you want to use nested groups, you can
add groups to other groups in Zulip and manage the individual members of each
subgroup in your SCIM provider.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Okta">
    <Steps>
      1. Follow the instructions [above](#configure-scim) to configure SCIM.
      1. [Rename](/help/manage-user-groups#change-a-user-groups-name-or-description)
         any Zulip groups that have the same names as groups that you want to sync. If
         you push a group whose name matches an existing Zulip group, the request will
         fail.
      1. Open the **Application** you set up above for the Zulip SCIM integration, and
         go to the **Push groups** tab. This menu allows you to choose the Okta groups
         which should be synchronized with Zulip's user groups.
    </Steps>

    <ZulipNote>
      SCIM `DELETE` requests are not supported for groups. To **Unlink** a group in
      Okta from the Zulip SCIM integration, select **Leave the group in the target
      app**. The **Delete the group in the target app** option is not supported.
