Zulip automatically saves the content of your message as a draft when you close
the compose box, ensuring that you never lose your work. When you start
composing, the most recently edited draft for the conversation you are composing
to automatically appears in the compose box.

<ZulipNote>
  **Note**: Drafts are local to your client, and are not synced to
  other devices and browsers.
