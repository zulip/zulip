Welcome to Zulip! This page will guide you through the process of transitioning
your organization from Slack to Zulip. It assumes that you have [completed your
initial evaluation](/help/trying-out-zulip) of Zulip, decided [whether to use
Zulip Cloud or self-host](/help/zulip-cloud-or-self-hosting), and are ready to
introduce Zulip to your organization.

If you're moving from other communication tools, check out the [general
guide on moving to Zulip](/help/moving-to-zulip).

The following steps are described in more detail below:

<Steps>
  1. [Import or create your organization](#import-or-create-your-organization).
  1. [Sign up for a plan](#sign-up-for-a-plan).
  1. [Configure your organization](#configure-your-organization).
  1. [Review and update communication
     policies](#review-and-update-communication-policies).
  1. [Prepare users for the transition](#prepare-users-for-the-transition).
  1. [Invite users to join](#invite-users-to-join).
</Steps>

Each organization is unique, but we hope these common practices will help you
think through the transition process in your own context.

## Import or create your organization

You can import your organization's Slack data, including message history, users,
channels, and custom emoji. Data is imported into Zulip as a new organization,
so the best time to import is when your team is about to start using Zulip for
day-to-day work. This may be part of your evaluation process, or after you've
made the decision to move to Zulip.

    <Steps>
      1. If you plan to self-host, [set up your Zulip
         server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html). You
         can self-host Zulip directly on Ubuntu or Debian Linux, in
         [Docker](https://github.com/zulip/docker-zulip), or with prebuilt images for
         [Digital Ocean](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/zulip) and
         [Render](https://render.com/docs/deploy-zulip).
      1. Follow the steps in the [Slack import guide](/help/import-from-slack).

    <Steps>
      1. If you plan to self-host, [set up your Zulip
         server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html). You
         can self-host Zulip directly on Ubuntu or Debian Linux, in
         [Docker](https://github.com/zulip/docker-zulip), or with prebuilt images for
         [Digital Ocean](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/zulip) and
         [Render](https://render.com/docs/deploy-zulip).
      1. Create a Zulip organization [on Zulip Cloud](https://zulip.com/new/) or
         [on your self-hosted
         server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html#step-3-create-a-zulip-organization-and-log-in).
         You can create a new Zulip Cloud organization in less than two minutes.
         Setting up a self-hosted server will take a bit longer, but is easy to
         do with Zulip's [robust
         installer](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html).

## Sign up for a plan

## Configure your organization

<FlattenedSteps>
  <ConfigureYourOrganization />

  1. [Create channels](/help/create-channels) if you decided not to import your
     Slack workspace. Zulip's [topics](/help/introduction-to-topics) give each
     conversation its own space, so one channel per team should be enough to get
     you started.
  1. Move your integrations using Zulip's [Slack-compatible incoming
     webhook](/integrations/doc/slack_incoming). You can transition to
     Zulip-native [integrations](/integrations) over time.
</FlattenedSteps>

## Review and update communication policies

<CommunicationPolicies />

* Zulip makes it easy to find conversations and follow up. To avoid disrupting
  focus work, @-mentions in Zulip should generally be reserved for
  time-sensitive messages. [Silent
  mentions](/help/mention-a-user-or-group#silently-mention-a-user) make it easy
  to refer to someone without calling for their attention.

## Prepare users for the transition

Prepare an introduction to Zulip for your organization. It often works well to
combine a written announcement with a live presentation. Recommended topics to
cover include:

<Steps>
  1. Brief introduction to Zulip.
  1. Why you're making this change. How do you expect it to improve communication
     in your organization?
     [https://zulip.com/why-zulip/](https://zulip.com/why-zulip/) may be a
     helpful reference.
  1. Accompanying changes to your communication policies. Are there any changes
     to common workflows?
  1. Pointers to additional resources, such as Zulip's [getting started
     guide](/help/getting-started-with-zulip).
  1. Transition timeline.
  1. How users will be supported during the transition.
</Steps>

## Invite users to join

If you imported your organization from Slack, [decide how users will log
in](/help/import-from-slack#decide-how-users-will-log-in) for the first time.
Otherwise:

<ZulipTip>
  Remember to update links and login instructions to point to Zulip.

Congratulations on making the move! If you have any questions or feedback
