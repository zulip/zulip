By default, Zulip requests a generally-accepted certificate during the
server install process, for the server's public hostname. In some
cases, a server administrator may choose not to use that feature, in
which case your Zulip server may be using a self-signed
certificate. This is most common for Zulip servers not connected to
the public internet.

## Web

Most browsers will show a warning if you try to connect to a Zulip server
with a self-signed certificate.

If you are absolutely, 100% sure that the Zulip server you are connecting to
is supposed to have a self-signed certificate, click through the warnings
and follow the instructions on-screen.

If you are less than 100% sure, contact your server
administrator. Accepting a malicious self-signed certificate would
give a stranger full access to your Zulip account, including your
username and password.

## Desktop

Zulip Desktop uses the operating system's certificate store, like your web
browser.

    On Windows, Zulip Desktop shares the certificate store with
    Google Chrome, so you can add certificates to it from inside
    Chrome.

      1. Open Google Chrome.
      1. From the Chrome menu (⋮) in the top-right, select **Settings**.
      1. In the **Privacy and Security** section, click **Security**.
      1. Scroll down to and click **Manage Certificates**.
      1. Select the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** tab.
      1. Select **Import...**
      1. Navigate to the certificate file, then click **Open**.

    The required packages and steps vary by distribution; see the Chromium
    documentation for [detailed documentation][linux].  On most systems,
    once the `nss` tools are installed, the command to trust the
    certificate is:

    ```bash "path/to/certificate.pem"
    certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "P,," -n zulip \
      -i path/to/certificate.pem
    ```

    You will need to restart the Zulip Desktop application to pick up the
    new certificate.
