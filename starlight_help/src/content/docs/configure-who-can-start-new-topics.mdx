You can restrict who can start new topics in a channel. For example, you can set
up:

* A channel where only some users can post new announcements, but
  everyone can discuss them.
* A channel with just a handful of topics everyone is expected to use.
* A channel for mirroring another messaging app, where each topic corresponds to
  a channel in the other app.

  You can also [configure who can send messages](/help/channel-posting-policy)
  to a channel.
