When you first create an account, Zulip uses an image generated by
[Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) as your profile picture. If your email
address already has a gravatar associated with it, Zulip will use your existing
gravatar.

Upload a custom profile picture when you configure your Zulip account.
