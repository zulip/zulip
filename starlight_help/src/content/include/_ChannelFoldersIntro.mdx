Organizations can sort channels into folders. For example, you can put all the
channels associated with a team into a dedicated folder. Users can decide
whether to group channels by folder in the [**Inbox**](/help/inbox) view and
the [left sidebar](/help/left-sidebar).

Everyone can [pin channels](/help/pin-a-channel) they personally want to pay
close attention to. Pinned channels appear in a dedicated **pinned channels**
section above channel folders.

Folders that only contain [inactive](/help/manage-inactive-channels) and
[muted](/help/mute-a-channel) channels are sorted at the bottom.
