* Many organizations find that with Zulip, there’s no longer a reason to use
  email for internal communications. You get the organization of an email
  [inbox](/help/inbox) together with all the features of a modern chat app,
  like instant delivery of messages, emoji reactions, typing notifications,
  @-mentions, and more.
* Because Zulip further organizes messages into conversations labeled with
  [topics](/help/introduction-to-topics), there is generally no need to create
  dedicated channels for specific projects.
* With conversations organized by topic, you can review prior discussions to
  understand past work, explanations, and decisions — your chat history
  becomes a knowledge base. Should it be standard practice to link to Zulip
  conversations from docs, issue trackers, etc. for additional context?
* Using Zulip, you can discuss complex topics and make decisions with input
  from all stakeholders, without the overhead of scheduling meeting. Are
  there standing meetings you might not need? For example, stand-ups can be
  replaced with dedicated check-in topics for each team member.
