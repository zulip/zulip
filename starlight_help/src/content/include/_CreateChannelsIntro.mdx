We recommend setting up some channels before inviting other users to
join Zulip, so that you can [automatically subscribe
everyone](/help/set-default-channels-for-new-users) to the right set of
channels.

If you later create additional channels, no worries! You can always subscribe
a group of users, or all the subscribers of another channel, to a new channel.

<ZulipTip>
  Add clear descriptions to your channels, especially public channels.
