First problem: Installing bots development environment. For no reason after cloning rep, command ./tools/provision doesn't work. I re-clone it in after entering to vargant, works fine now :)

Second problem: Created zuliprc-my-bot folder outside the rep, so I cannot launch the bot. Moving it into "zulip" folder solved everything ;)

No other problems, everything works fine!
