# How do I get in touch with the Zulip community?

The primary communication forum for the Zulip community is [chat.zulip.org](https://chat.zulip.org/).


- **Zulip users** and **administrators** of Zulip organizations stop by to ask questions and offer feedback.
- **Contributors to the project**, including the **core Zulip development team**, discuss ongoing and future projects, brainstorm ideas, and generally help each other out.

Anyone is welcome to [sign up](https://chat.zulip.org/) and drop by — we love hearing from our users! We’ve curated steam subscription lists for users, administrators and contributors.

To get help in real time, you will have the best luck finding core developers during daylight hours in North America (roughly between 15:00 UTC and 1:00 UTC), but the sun never sets on the Zulip community. Most questions get a reply within minutes to a few hours.

# Community norms
- Send test messages to [#test here](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/7-test-here) or as a PM to yourself to avoid disturbing others.
- When asking for help, provide the details needed for others to help you. For example, include the full traceback in a [code block](https://zulip.com/help/code-blocks) (not a screenshot), a link to the code or a WIP PR you’re having trouble debugging, etc.
- Ask questions on streams rather than PMing core contributors. You’ll get answers faster since other people can help, and it makes it possible for other developers to learn from reading the discussion.
- Use @-mentions sparingly. Unlike IRC or Slack, in Zulip, it’s usually easy to see which message you’re replying to, so you don’t need to mention your conversation partner in every reply. Core developers will often @-mention someone who dropped by to ask a question to make sure they see the reply, but there is generally no need to @-mention a core developer unless the message is really urgent.
- Converse informally; there’s no need to use titles like “Sir” or “Madam”.
- Use [gender-neutral language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_language). For example, avoid using a pronoun like her or his in sentences like “Every developer should clean [their] keyboard at least once a week.”
- Follow the community [code of conduct](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code-of-conduct.html).
- Participate! Zulip is a friendly and welcoming community, and we love meeting new people, hearing about what brought them to Zulip, and getting their feedback. If you’re not sure where to start, introduce yourself and your interests in [#new members](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/95-new-members), using your name as the topic.
# Where do I send my message?

[chat.zulip.org](https://chat.zulip.org/) has a few [streams](https://zulip.com/help/about-streams-and-topics) you should know about. Kick off the discussion by [starting a new topic](https://zulip.com/help/start-a-new-topic)! You can always find the description for the stream you’re reading at the top.

## Streams for everyone
- [#feedback](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/137-feedback) is for posting feedback on Zulip, including feature requests, things you’d like to see polished.

- Everyone is welcome to introduce themselves in [#new members](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/95-new-members). Posting here with your name as the topic is a great option if you’re uncertain where to start a conversation.
- [#test here](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/7-test-here) is for sending test messages without inconveniencing other users :). We recommend muting this stream when not using it.

Note that GitHub is our primarily system for managing code review.
- [#backend](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/3-backend), [#frontend](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/6-frontend), and app-specific streams ([#mobile](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/48-mobile), etc.) are for getting help with various categories of work.

- [#discussions](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/277-discussions) is where we do fun community conversations like “Ask Me Anything” Q&A sessions with project members.
- [#documentation](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/19-documentation) is where we discuss improving Zulip’s user, sysadmin, API, and developer documentation.

# Anything else to keep in mind?
## Don’t try to read *everything*

To make it easier to find your way around, we automatically add new users to a large bundle of streams. When you join, you may feel flooded with information — the **chat.zulip.org** community sends several thousand messages every single week.

Keeping up with **everything** happening in the Zulip project is both difficult and rarely a useful goal. To make the best use of your time, we highly recommend that you unsubscribe from streams that you aren’t interested in, and mute streams that are only of occasional interest.

## Searching for past conversations

When [searching](https://zulip.com/help/search-for-messages) for previous discussions of a given topic, we recommend using the following query: `streams:public <your keyword(s)>`.

This will search the full history of public streams for `<your keyword(s)>`, including messages sent before you joined and messages on public streams you’re not subscribed to.

## New features are tested here

We frequently test out new features or ideas on chat.zulip.org before rolling them out to everyone (or deciding not to!). Please report in #issues anything you notice that seems wrong!
