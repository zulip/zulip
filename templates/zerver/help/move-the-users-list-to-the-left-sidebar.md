# Move the user list to the left sidebar

By default, the **Users** list is displayed on the right side of the Zulip window.
On mobile devices with narrow screens, the **Users** list is hidden to save space.
If you would like to see the **Users** list on your mobile device, you can
choose to move it to the left side of the screen.

You can easily change the location of the **Users** list by following a few steps.

    When this option is selected, the user list located on the right by default will be listed under the **Streams** section in the left sidebar when the window size is under 1165 pixels.
