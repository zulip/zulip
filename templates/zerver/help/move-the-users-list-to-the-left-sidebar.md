# Move the users list to the left sidebar

By default, the **Users** list is displayed on the right sidebar located at the
right of the Zulip window. However, on devices with narrow screen widths of
under 1165 pixels, the right sidebar is hidden to save space. If you would like
to see the **Users** list on your mobile device, you can choose to move it to
the left side of the screen under the **Streams** section in the left sidebar.

You can easily change the location of the **Users** list by following a few
steps.

1. Go to the [Display settings](/#settings/display-settings)
{!settings.md!}

2. Select the option labeled
    **User list on left sidebar in narrow windows**, then reload the page
    in order for the change to take effect.
