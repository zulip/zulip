2. Select **Invite users** from the dropdown menu that appears.

5. In the section labeled **Streams they should join**, select the options of any streams that you want the users you invite to be subscribed to by default. Only streams that you're subscribed to are displayed; the **Check all** option selects all streams, while the **Uncheck all** option deselects all streams.
