# Message formatting

Zulip uses a variant of GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) to allow you to easily format your messages.

## Summary

For a summary of message formatting in Zulip, click the (![A](/static/images/help/formatting.png)) icon located at the bottom left of your messaging box or the cog (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) in the upper right corner of the right sidebar and choose “Message formatting” from the drop-down menu.

The following modal window will appear.

## Links

To include hyperlinks in your messages, you can either enter the link's url address directly or surround the link's display text with`[brackets]` and the url address of the link in `(parentheses)` immediately after.

Unfortunately, Zulip currently does not support image embedding through links.

## Lists

Begin each item in your list with `* an asterisk followed by a space` to include lists in your messages.

## Emojis

Zulip features a variety of emojis provided by the [Noto Project](https://code.google.com/p/noto/). To include emojis in your messages, surround the emoji phrase with `:colons:`.

A dropdown will appear with suggested emojis as you enter the emoji phrase.

## Mentions

To call the attention of another member, you can alert other users by typing `@**username**"`

If you type `@` and then begin typing their email address or one of their names, and the system will offer you auto-completion suggestions.

Typing `@**all**` will alert all users in the stream, and a confirmation message will appear.

`back-ticks`
`` to display it as inline code.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with <code>`````` three back-ticks```<code>```</code>.
