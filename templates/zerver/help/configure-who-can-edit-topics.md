# Restrict topic editing

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, anyone can edit any message topic. This is useful because it
allows the community to keep conversations organized, even if some members
are still learning how to use topics effectively.

However, you can restrict the permission to edit topics of any message
to other sets of roles:

* Organization administrators
* Organization administrators and moderators
* Organization administrators and all members
* Organization administrators and [full members](/help/restrict-permissions-of-new-members)

Note that users may still be able to edit the topic of messages with
**(no topic)**; see the full article on [message and topic
editing](/help/configure-message-editing-and-deletion) for details.

Also, only administrators and moderators can edit the topics of
messages that were sent more than 3 days ago, regardless of the value
of this setting.

### Change who can edit topics

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-permissions}

2. Under **Message editing**, configure **Who can edit the topic of any message**.

{end_tabs}
