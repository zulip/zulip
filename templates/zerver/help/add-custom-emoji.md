# Add custom emoji

If enabled by your Zulip organization administrator, you can add custom
emojis to your organization for other members to use.

1. Go to the [Emoji Settings](/#organization/emoji-settings)
{!admin.md!}

5. In the green section labeled **Add a new emoji**, find the **Emoji name** and
**Emoji URL** fields.

    * In the **Emoji name** field, enter a phrase for your emoji. Only
      alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores are allowed,
      but dashes and underscores cannot end an emoji phrase.

        Users will use the designated emoji phrase surrounded by
        colons to insert your emoji into their messages.

    * Click the **Upload emoji** button to upload and specify the image of your
    custom emoji.

        Please note that the image will be scaled down to 25x25 pixels
        in users' messages.

6. After filling out the **Emoji name** field and uploading the emoji image,
click the **Add emoji** button to add your custom emoji to your
Zulip organization.

7. Upon clicking the **Add emoji** button, you will receive a notification
labeled **Custom emoji added!** in the **Add a new emoji** section, confirming
the success of the addition of your custom emoji to your organization.

    The emoji's information and settings will also be displayed above the
    **Add a new emoji** section. You can also delete a custom emoji in
    your organization through this panel by clicking the trash (<i
    class="icon-vector-trash"></i>) icon to the right of the icon you wish to
    delete.

Users in your organization can now use your emoji in their messages.
