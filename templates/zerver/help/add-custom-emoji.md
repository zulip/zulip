# Add custom emoji

By default, anyone can add custom emoji to a Zulip organization. Added emoji
are available to all users.

Organization administrators can also
[change who can add custom emoji](/help/only-allow-admins-to-add-emoji).

## Add a custom emoji

{settings_tab|emoji-settings}

1. Under **Add a new emoji**, enter an **emoji name**.

    Emoji names can only contain `a-z`, `0-9`, dashes (`-`), and
    spaces. Upper and lower case letters will be treated the same, and
    underscores (`_`) will be treated the same as spaces.

1. Click **Upload emoji** and add an image or GIF. The image will
   automatically be scaled to 25x25 pixels.

1. Click **Add emoji**.

## Replace a default emoji

You can replace a default emoji by adding a custom emoji of the same
name. If an emoji has several names, you must use the emoji's primary name
to replace it. You can find the primary name of an emoji by hovering over it
in the [emoji picker](/help/add-emoji), while the search box is empty (you
may have to scroll down a bit to find it).

## Delete a custom emoji

{settings_tab|emoji-settings}

1. Click the trash icon next to the emoji that you would like to delete.

Deleting an emoji will not affect any existing messages or emoji
reactions. Anyone can delete custom emoji they added, and organization
administrators can delete anyone's custom emoji.
