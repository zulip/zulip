5. In the green section labeled **Add a New Emoji**, find the **Emoji name** and
**Emoji URL** fields.

    * In the **Emoji name** field, enter a phrase for your emoji. Only alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores are allowed, but dashes and underscores cannot end an emoji phrase.

        Users will use the designated emoji phrase surrounded by colons to
        insert your emoji into their messages.

    * In the **Emoji URL** field, insert the link to your custom emoji's image. The
    link must start with **http://** or **https://**.

        Please note that the image will be scaled down to 25x25 pixels in users' messages.

6. After filling out the **Emoji name** and **Emoji URL** fields, click the blue
**Add emoji** button to add your custom emoji to your Zulip organization.

7. Upon clicking the **Add emoji** button, you will receive a notification
labeled **Custom emoji added!** in the **Add a New Emoji** section, confirming
the success of the addition of your custom emoji to your organization.
