# Change your email address

If enabled by Zulip organization administrator, you can change your email address
using the following steps.

1. Go to the [Your account](/#settings/your-account)
{!settings.md!}

2. Click on the **[Change]** link beside your email address.

    !!! warn ""
        **Note:** If you do not see the [Change] link,
        it is probably because your organization's administrators
        have disabled change of email addresses.
        If that's the case, then you need to ask them to
        allow users to change their email address.

3. Change your email in the **Email** field.

4. Click on the **Change** button to receive a confirmation mail.

5. Click on the **Confirmation link** send to your new email address.

Congratulations! You have updated your email address.
