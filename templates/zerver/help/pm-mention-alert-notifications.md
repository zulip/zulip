# PMs, mentions, and alerts

You can configure desktop, mobile, and email notifications for
[private messages](/help/private-messages), [mentions](/help/mention-a-user-or-group), and
[alert words](/help/add-an-alert-word).

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Toggle the notification settings under **Private messages and @-mentions**.

These settings will affect notifications for private messages, group private
messages, mentions, and alert words. The one exception is that we never
send email notifications for `@all` or `@everyone` mentions.

You can also hide the content of private messages (and group private
messages) from desktop notifications.
Under **Visual desktop notifications**, uncheck
**Include content of private messages**.
