# Edit your profile

By default, your profile includes your name, email, the date you joined, and
when you were last active.

Organization administrators can also
[add custom profile fields](/help/add-custom-profile-fields). Custom profile
fields are always optional, and will not appear in your profile unless you
fill them out.

### Edit your profile

{settings_tab|your-account}

1. Edit the fields under **Profile**.

!!! warn ""
    Note: The **Profile** section will only appear if an organization
    administrator has added custom profile fields.
