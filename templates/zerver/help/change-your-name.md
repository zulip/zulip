# Change your name

By default, everyone can change their name in Zulip. You can write your name
in any language you'd like.

Organization administrators can [change anyone's name](/help/change-a-users-name), and
[prevent users from changing their names](/help/restrict-name-and-email-changes). This
is useful when users' names are managed via LDAP or another data source.

    [prevent users from changing their names](/help/restrict-name-and-email-changes)
    to view your organization's settings.

## Reserved words

The words "all", "everyone", and "stream" have special meanings, and if you choose them as your
display name, nobody will be able to [mention](/help/mention-a-user-or-group) you.
