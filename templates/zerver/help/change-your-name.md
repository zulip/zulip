you can spell your name exactly how you'd like it to be displayed.

        **Note:** If you are unable to edit your name,
        it is probably because your organization's administrators
        have disabled users from doing so.
        If that's the case, then you need to ask them to
        allow users to change their name.

{!save-changes.md!} account settings.

Congratulations! You have updated your name.

    Note that your old messages will still have the previous version of your
    name.
