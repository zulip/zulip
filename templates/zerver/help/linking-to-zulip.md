# Linking to Zulip

You can link to your Zulip from the web with a Zulip
[shields.io](https://github.com/badges/shields) badge:

Good places for the badge include your project's landing page, support
pages, and/or GitHub homepage.

To embed a Zulip badge, copy and paste the following, replacing
`https://chat.zulip.org` with the URL of your Zulip organization:

<a href="https://chat.zulip.org"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/zulip-join_chat-brightgreen.svg" /></a>
```
