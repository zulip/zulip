# Getting started with Zulip

Welcome to Zulip! Like any new tool, mastering Zulip will take some time,
but once you get the hang of it, you'll never want to use another chat
service again.

## Understand

Read our [guide to streams and topics](/help/about-streams-and-topics) to familiarize
yourself with Zulip's conversation model.

If this is your first time using Zulip, we recommend starting with the web
or desktop experience.

## Set up your account

- [Set a profile picture](/help/set-your-avatar)
- Get the [mobile and desktop apps](/apps)
- [Browse and subscribe to streams](/help/browse-and-subscribe-to-streams)
- [Configure your notifications](/#settings/notifications) to work the way
  you do. If you're joining a low traffic organization and aren't using the
  desktop app, consider sending all messages to email.
- [Review your settings](/help/review-your-settings)

## Basic workflows

A few basic workflows are useful when getting oriented.

### For reading

- Use the left sidebar (or the `n` key) to review messages thread-by-thread.
- Use the down arrow key (`↓`) to move the cursor to the next message.
- Use the End key to mark all messages in the current view as read.

### For writing

- To reply to a message, click on it, or use `r` or `Enter` to reply to the
  message under the blue box.
- When starting a new conversation, remember to start a new topic. Don't
  overthink it; the first 2-3 words that come to your mind are probably
  fine. Using topics may take some attention at the beginning, but after a
  few days of using Zulip it will feel like second nature.
- It is totally normal to have 5 conversations happening in a stream at the
  same time; each on its own topic. So don't worry about interrupting; each
  conversation has its own space.
- It is totally normal for conversations to last many hours or days, even in
  busy streams. Don't worry about replying long after a message is sent;
  everyone will see your reply in context.

## Advanced

- Master a few [keyboard shortcuts](/help/keyboard-shortcuts). Start
  with `n`, `↓`, `c`, and `Enter`, and use `?` for help.
- Learn how to
  [format your messages](/help/format-your-message-using-markdown) using
  Markdown.
