# Add an alert word

Zulip allows you to define alert words and phrases that notify you as if you
were [@-mentioned](/help/at-mention-a-team-member) by another user whenever the
alert word is included in a message sent to a stream that you are subscribed to.

Alert words will be highlighted within messages, and you will be alerted in
accordance with your [notification settings](/#settings/notifications).

1. Go to the [Alert words](/#settings/alert-words)
{!settings.md!}

2. In the section labeled **Add a new alert word**, input the word/phrase you
wish to be notified for into the **New alert word** field.

    !!! tip ""
        Alert words/phrases are matched case-insensitive, which means you don't
        have to care about capitalization when defining them.

3. After filling out the **Add a new alert word** field, click on the
**Add alert word** button.

4. Upon clicking the **Add alert word** button, the defined alert word will
appear in the **Add a new alert word** section, confirming the success of the
addition of the specified alert word.

    !!! tip ""
        An alert word can be removed by clicking the trash (<i
        class="icon-vector-trash"></i>) icon to the right of the particular
        alert word.
