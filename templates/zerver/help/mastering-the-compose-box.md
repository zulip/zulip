# Mastering the compose box

When composing a message, Zulip lets you view a different conversation from the
one you are composing to. For example, you can start a new topic without
changing your narrow, send a private message about the topic you're viewing, or
look up a related discussion.

In this context, the parts of the message view that are outside of the
conversation you are composing to are faded for clarity.

## Go to conversation

To narrow the view to the conversation you're currently composing to,
click on the **Go to conversation** (<i class="zulip-icon
   zulip-icon-arrow-left-circle"></i>) button in the compose box.

You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl` + `.` to go to the conversation to
which you are composing.

While the button is only shown when composing to a stream, the keyboard shortcut
will work in both stream messages and private messages.
