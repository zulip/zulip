# Change the privacy of a stream

{!admin-only.md!}

Streams can be [web-public](/help/web-public-streams), public or private,
and private streams can have shared or protected history.
See [stream permissions](/help/stream-permissions) for
details on stream privacy settings.

As an organization administrator, you can always make a public stream
private, but you must be subscribed to a private stream in order to make it
public.

    accessible, even if the stream previously had protected history.
