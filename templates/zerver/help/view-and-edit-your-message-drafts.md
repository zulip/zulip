# View and edit your message drafts

When you close the compose box, Zulip stores the content in a draft, so that
you never lose your work. Drafts are saved for **30 days**.

!!! warn ""
    **Note:** Drafts are local to your client. For
    example, drafts you create in the web application will not be accessible
    from the mobile app, and vice versa.

## Desktop and web

To **save a draft**, simply close the compose box. You can hit `Esc`, click
the <i class="icon-vector-remove"></i> in the upper right corner of the
compose box, or click on an empty part of the app.

To **view your drafts**, click on `Drafts` at the bottom of the screen.
From there, you can **delete** or **restore** any of your drafts.

!!! tip ""
    Use `d` to bring up the list of drafts. From there you can use the arrow
    keys, `Backspace`/`Delete`, or `Enter` to restore. A common pattern is `d` +
    `Enter` to restore the last draft.
