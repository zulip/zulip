# Message display settings

By default, messages in Zulip are displayed in English with a 12-hour timestamp, and the user list is displayed on the right side of the window.

However, there are a few reasons you might want to modify your message display settings. For example, you may want to do this if you speak a non-English language as your first language, are used to a 24-hour convention for displaying time, or have a narrow screen and want to conserve space.

## Display options
Listed below are the current message display settings that Zulip supports. After editing your message display settings, you will need to reload your screen for any changes you make to take effect.

### Select default language
