# Set organization guidelines URL

Zulip organization administrators may set a custom URL that points to
guidelines for their organization. 

This custom URL can be set and adjusted via the gear menu under the
"Manage organization" tab. When the "Organization guidelines" field
is set, a banner will be displayed to all members that links to the
set URL. 

Once a user has viewed these guidelines, the banner will not
be shown again. If set, the guidelines URL will always be available to
all users via the gear menu.
