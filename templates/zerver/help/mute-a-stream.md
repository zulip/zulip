# Mute a stream

Messages from muted streams do not show up in **All messages** or generate
notifications, unless you are
[mentioned](/help/mention-a-user-or-group). Messages from muted streams
do not generate [alert word](/help/add-an-alert-word) notifications.

Muted streams still appear in the left sidebar, though they are grayed out.

!!! tip ""
    Some parts of the Zulip experience may start to degrade
    if you receive more than a few hundred muted messages a day.
