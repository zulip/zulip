# Add or invite someone to a stream

You might want to add a user to a particular stream that they haven't
subscribed to yet so that they can send and read messages in that
stream. In Zulip, you can add users to a public stream even if you
aren't subscribed to that particular stream, but you must be
subscribed to a private stream in order to invite a user to join that
stream.

You can add users to streams, both public and private, that you're
subscribed to.
