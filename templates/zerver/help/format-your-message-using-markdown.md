# Message formatting

Zulip uses a variant of GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) to allow you to easily format your messages.

## Summary

For a summary of message formatting in Zulip, click the ![A](/static/images/help/formatting.png) icon located at the bottom left of your messaging box or the cog (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) in the upper right corner of the right sidebar and choose “Message formatting” from the drop-down menu.

The following modal window will appear.

You can surround your text with a combination of asterisks `*` and tildes `~` to emphasize words or phrases in your messages.

### Italics

## Links

To include hyperlinks in your messages, you can either enter the link's url address directly or surround the link's display text with`[brackets]` and the url address of the link in `(parentheses)` immediately after.

Zulip currently does not support image embedding through links.

## Stream Links

To link to another stream in one of your messages, you can either type `#streamName` and click the stream name in the popup, or you can start with `#` and surround your message with double asteriks `**`.

## Lists

Begin each item in your list with `* an asterisk followed by a space` to include lists in your messages.

## Emojis

Zulip features a variety of emojis provided by the [Noto Project](https://code.google.com/p/noto/). To include emojis in your messages, surround the emoji phrase with `:colons:`.

A dropdown will appear with suggested emojis as you enter the emoji phrase.

A complete list of emojis can be found [here](http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/).

## Mentions

To call the attention of another member, you can alert them by typing `@**username**`

If you type `@` and then begin typing the user's email address or the user's name, the system will offer you auto-completion suggestions.

Typing `@**all**` will alert all users in the stream, and a confirmation message will appear.

## Code

You can surround a portion of code with ``
`back-ticks`
`` to display it as inline code.

Multi-line blocks of code are either fenced by lines with <code>`````` three back-ticks```<code>```</code></code> or indented with four spaces.

In addition, to highlight language syntax, add the file extension of the language (for example, Python would be **.py**) right after the first set of back-ticks.

## Quotes

To insert quotes, you can either add a greater-than symbol ```>``` and a space before your phrase or submit it as a quote block by following the code syntax highlighting format.
