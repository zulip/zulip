# Private messages

**Private messages (PMs)** are one-on-one conversations between you and
another user. **Group private messages (group PMs)** are small
discussions with a group of users.

PMs and group PMs work well for one-off conversations. If you find yourself
frequently conversing with the same person or the same group of people, we
highly recommend [creating a private stream](/help/create-a-stream) for your
conversations instead.

Note that group PMs are not the same as [user groups](/help/user-groups) or private
streams. PMs and group PMs do not have
[topics](/help/about-streams-and-topics), and do not appear in your list of
streams.
