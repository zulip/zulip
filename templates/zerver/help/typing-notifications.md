# Typing notifications

Zulip displays typing notifications when viewing a private message or
group private message conversation to which one of the other
participants is currently composing a message.

Typing notifications are only sent while one is actively editing text
in the compose box, and they disappear if typing is paused for about
15 seconds.  Just having the compose box open will not send a typing
notification.

### Disable typing notifications

If you'd prefer that others not know whether you're typing, you can
configure Zulip to not send typing notifications.

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|account-and-privacy}

1. Under **Privacy**, toggle **Let recipients see when I'm typing
   private messages**.

{end_tabs}
