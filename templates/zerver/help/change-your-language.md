# Change your language

By default, the Zulip UI is displayed in English.  However, Zulip has
full support for internationalization, and the UI has been translated
into many other languages.  You can see the Zulip UI in other
languages temporarily by modifying the URLs using the appropriate
language code, e.g. `/ru/` for Russian.

Additionally, you can change the default language in the Zulip UI for
your Zulip account using the following procedure.

    **Warning**: Because for languages, only some of the strings in
    the Zulip UI have been translated, you may still see English words
    interspersed throughout Zulip.

1. Go to the [Display settings](/#settings/display-settings)
{!settings.md!}

2. Next to the **Default language** heading, select the **[Change]** link.

3. After clicking the **[Change]** link, a modal window will appear with all
foreign languages that Zulip supports along with their percentages of
translation support. Select your desired language from the window.

4. Once you select a language, the modal window will close. Zulip will be
displayed in the language of your choice after you reload the page.
