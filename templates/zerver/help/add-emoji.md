# Add emoji

Emoji are little characters and that add some fun to your messages! This guide
shows you how to send messages containing emoji by using Zulip’s built-in emoji
menu, pasting Unicode, or manually inputting the emoji code.

## Using the emoji menu
1. Start by composing a [new message](/help/reply-to-a-message).
2. Click the smiley face (<i class="icon-vector-smile"></i>) icon under the left
edge of the message box.
3. Click on any emoji to include it in your message.

## Pasting Unicode
Zulip fully supports Unicode emoji. To use Unicode emoji in your message:

1. Copy any emoji you would like to include onto your clipboard, such as 😀.
2. Compose a [new message or reply](/help/reply-to-a-message).
3. Paste the emoji into the message box.

    You can browse the
    [Unicode Consortium's full list of emoji](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html);
    however, Zulip emoji may appear different than the ones listed.

## Using emoji codes
1. Start by composing a new message or reply.
2. Type in the emoji code surrounded by colons. For example, `:smile:` produces
the <img src="/static/generated/emoji/images/emoji/smile.png"
alt="smile" style="width: 3%;"/> emoji.

    If you are unsure of the code for any particular emoji, visit
    [Emoji Cheat Sheet](http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/)
    for a complete list. Furthermore, after typing `:` and any two letters,
    autocomplete suggestions will appear. These emoji contain the letters you
    typed and are sorted alphabetically by code. You can also cycle through
    these suggestions by using the `↑` and `↓` arrow keys.
