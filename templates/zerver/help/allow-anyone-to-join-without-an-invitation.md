# Allow anyone to join without an invitation

By default, new users can join a Zulip organization with or without an email
invitation.

However, if you are a realm administrator that wants to limit the membership of
your organization, you can choose to limit new members to those with email
invitations.

## Limiting new membership to users invited by organization members

{!admin.md!}

4. Locate the **E-mail invitation required** checkbox.

    To limit new members of your organization to those who have been
    invited to do so, click the **E-mail invitation required** checkbox.

    New users will now require an email invitation sent by a user in your Zulip
organization to join your organization.

    * If you wish to further limit new membership to your organization, you can
    [only allow administrators](/help/only-allow-admins-to-invite-new-users) in
    your organization to send email invitations to new users.

5. To save any changes you have made to your organization settings, click the
**Save changes** button at the bottom of the **Organizations settings**
section.
