# Allow anyone to join without an invitation

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, new users can join a Zulip organization with or without an email
invitation.

However, if you are an organization administrator that wants to limit
the membership of your organization, you can choose to limit new
members to those with email invitations.

## Limiting new membership to users invited by organization members

4. Locate the **Users cannot join without an invitation** checkbox under the
**Joining the organization** section.

    To limit new members of your organization to those who have been
    invited to do so, click the **Users cannot join without an invitation** checkbox.

    New users will now require an email invitation sent by a user in your Zulip
organization to join your organization.

    * If you wish to further limit new membership to your organization, you can
    [only allow administrators](/help/only-allow-admins-to-invite-new-users) in
    your organization to send email invitations to new users.
