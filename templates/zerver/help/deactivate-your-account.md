  you've shared. If permitted in your organization, delete content you'd
  like to remove before deactivating your account.

* You cannot register a Zulip account using the email
  address of a deactivated account. If you change your mind about deactivating
  an account, an organization administrator can
  [reactivate](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user#reactivate-a-user)
  your account at any time.
