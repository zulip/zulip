{!settings.md!}

2. Click the **Deactivate account** button on the bottom of the
   **Your account** section.

4. After clicking the **Deactivate account** button, a modal window titled
**Deactivate your account** will appear. To confirm the deletion of your
account, click the **Deactivate now** button.

        **Note:** Any bots that you maintain will be disabled when you
        deactivate your account.

6. After clicking the **Deactivate now** button, you will be logged
   out and returned to the Zulip login page.

Please note that you cannot register a Zulip account using the email address of
a deactivated account.

In addition, if you're the only administrator in the organization, you cannot
deactivate your account; you need to make another user an administrator first
before you can deactivate your account.

!!! tip ""
    If you regret deactivating your account, you can ask a Zulip organization
    administrator to
    [reactivate](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user#reactivate-a-user) your
    account.
