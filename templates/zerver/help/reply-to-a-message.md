# Reply to a Message
There are three ways to reply to a message in Zulip.
## Click on a message
To reply to a message, click on it.
A message compose box will appear with the **Stream** (outlined in red
below) and **Topic** (outlined in green below) fields
autofilled to match the message you clicked on.

## The `r` hotkey
On the Zulip home screen, you will notice a blue box around one of the
messages on your screen.

This box indicates which message is currently highlighted.
It is found on the home screen, in all streams, in your private
messages, in your starred messages, and in your @-mentions.

You can change which message is highlighted by scrolling or
using the arrow or `j` and `k` keys on your keyboard.
Pressing the `r` key on your keyboard will open a message compose
box to type your reply in.
This box will appear with the **Stream** (outlined in red below)
and **Topic** (outlined in green below) fields
autofilled to match the message that you highlighted.

## Discard your reply

At any time you can discard your reply by clicking the **x**
(![x](/static/images/help/x.png)) icon located at the top-right corner
of the messaging box or by pressing the `esc` key on your keyboard.
This message will be saved as a draft if you wish to restore it later.
