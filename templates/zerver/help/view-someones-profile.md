# View someone's profile

A user's profile includes their name, email, role, the date they joined,
when they were last active, and any
[custom profile fields](/help/add-custom-profile-fields) they've filled out.

It also contains additional tabs showing a user's subscribed streams
and user groups. Note that the information in those tabs is limited to
streams for which [you can see all subscribers](/help/stream-permissions).
