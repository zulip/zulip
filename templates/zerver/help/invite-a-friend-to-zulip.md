4. In the section labeled **Streams they should join**, select the
   options of any streams that you want the users you invite to be
   subscribed to by default. Only streams that you're subscribed to
   are displayed; the **Check all** option selects all streams, while
   the **Uncheck all** option deselects all streams.

5. After you have finished inputting all fields, click the
   **Invite** button in the bottom right corner. A section labeled
   **Users invited successfully.** will appear in the modal to confirm
   the success of your invitation.
