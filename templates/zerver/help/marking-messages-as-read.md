# Marking messages as read

Zulip automatically keeps track of which messages you have and haven't
read. Unread messages have a dark line along their left side, which fade as
the message gets marked as read.

There are two situations in which messages automatically get marked as read.

* **End of feed**: When you get to the bottom of a view, Zulip marks all
  messages in that view as read.

* **Blue box**: Messages are marked as read when the blue box passes over
  them.

You can move the blue box either with the keyboard (arrow keys, `End`, etc.)
or by scrolling the feed with your mouse.

You can also manually mark all messages as read, or mark all messages in a
stream or topic as read.
