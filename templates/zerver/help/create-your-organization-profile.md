# Create your organization profile

{!admin-only.md!}

The information in your organization profile is displayed on your
registration and login pages, and in the desktop and mobile apps. As
an example, here is what the registration page for the Zulip community
server looked like at one point:

![settings](/static/images/help/organization-profile-example.png)

Note that the Organization description supports full Markdown syntax,
including bold/italic, links, lists, and
[more](/help/format-your-message-using-markdown).

### Create your organization profile

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-profile}

1. Edit your organization **name**, **description**, and **avatar**.
1. Click **Save changes**.

{end_tabs}

## Add a wide logo

Zulip also allows you to customize the logo your users see in the upper left
of the main, logged-in view. For best results make sure the logo has a
transparent background, and trim the logo of any bordering whitespace.

### Add a wide logo

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-profile}

1. Under **Organization logo**, upload a new logo.

{end_tabs}

Make sure to test the logo in both day mode and [night mode](/help/night-mode).
