# Press Enter to send

By default, Zulip sends your message when you press enter (or return) on your keyboard. If you want to turn this off, simply uncheck the **Press Enter to send** box below the compose field:

![Box checked](/static/images/help/enter-box-checked.png)

You will now see a **Send** button below the compose field looking like this.

![Box unchecked](/static/images/help/enter-box-unchecked.png)

With the box unchecked, you will have to click the **Send** button to send your message. Pressing enter will no longer send your message.

If you’d like to re-enable the press enter to send feature, just check the **Press Enter to send** box again, and you will be able to send your messages by pressing enter.
