# Delete a stream

{!admin-only.md!}

In Zulip, most stream administration is done on the subscription page.
However, Zulip organization administrators must use the Zulip
**[organization administration interface](/help/change-your-organization-settings)**
to delete streams.

1. Go to the [Delete streams](/#organization/streams-list-admin)
{!admin.md!}

2. Find the stream you want to delete, and click the **Delete stream** button to
the right of it.

3. Upon clicking on the **Delete stream** button, a confirmation window titled
**Delete stream (stream name)** will appear. Click the **Yes, delete this stream**
button to delete the stream.

!!! warn ""
    **Warning:** Please be aware of the consequences of deleting a stream,
    since this operation is irreversible. Deleting a stream will immediately
    unsubscribe all users from the stream, and the stream's content will not be
    recoverable.
