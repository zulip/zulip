# User groups

User groups allow you to [mention](/help/mention-a-user-or-group) multiple
members at once. When you mention a user group, everyone in the group is
[notified](/help/pm-mention-alert-notifications) as if they were
individually mentioned.

Note that user groups are not the same as group private messages. If you're
trying to send a group of people a message, you'll want to either
[create a stream](/help/create-a-stream), or send a
[group private message](/help/private-messages).
