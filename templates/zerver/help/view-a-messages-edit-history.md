The **Message edit history** modal shows all edits to a message, sorted from
earliest to latest.

Each entry in the **Message edit history** modal has the following properties:

1. Highlighted **differences** (additions in green, deletions in red) between
the previous message edit and the current version.

2. **Timestamp** of the message edit.

3. **Author** of the message edit.

    To exit the **Message edit history** modal, simply click the x (<i
    class="icon-vector-remove"></i>) icon in the top right-hand corner or the
    **Close** button in the bottom right corner.
