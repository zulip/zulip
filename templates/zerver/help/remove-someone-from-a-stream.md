# Remove user from stream

As an administrator, Zulip allows you to remove users from streams to
help manage your Zulip team. You can do this by accessing the
**subscriptions page**.

### Finding the subscriptions page

There are multiple ways to navigate to the subscriptions page. You can
either:

{!subscriptions.md!}

or

1. Click the **cog** (![cog](/static/images/help/cog.png)) icon
   located in the **left sidebar** next to **Streams**

![Streams Cog](/static/images/help/streams-1.png)

### Remove user
Once on the **subscriptions page**:

1. Select the stream you wish to remove the user from by either
   searching for its name or finding it in the streams list.
2. Under **Stream Settings**, scroll down to the **Stream Membership**
   section.
3. Finally, find the user you wish to remove in the subscribers list
   and click **unsubscribe**.

Congratulations, you're finished! You can now exit the **subscriptions
page** by clicking the "**X**" in the top right corner of the modal.
