# Zulip User Documentation

Zulip is a group chat app. Its most distinctive characteristic is that
conversation within an organization can be divided into “**streams**”
and further subdivided into “**topics**”, so that
much finer-grained conversations are possible than with IRC or other
chat tools.

Most people use Zulip on the Web. There are also mobile apps for
Android/iOS, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows, as well as a
cross-platform version and a version for Platform 9. See
[the documentation on apps](/apps) for more information.

One Zulip account, associated with a particular group or organization, is known
as an **organization**.
