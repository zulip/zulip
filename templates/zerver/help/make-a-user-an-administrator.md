# Make a user an administrator

By default, everyone in an organization is a user; this limits them from
modifying organization-wide settings, such as changing the organization name,
activating or deactivating users, deleting streams, etc. Zulip organization
administrators can give a user administrative rights. To do so, follow the steps
below:

{!go-to-the.md!} [Users](/#administration/user-list-admin)
{!admin.md!}

4. Click on the **Make admin** button for the user that you wish to make an
administrator.

    After clicking the **Make admin** button, the selected user's browser will
reload and the user will gain administrative privileges immediately.

## Revoke administrative rights from a user

Administrators can also revoke the administrative rights given to a user.

{!go-to-the.md!} [Users](/#administration/user-list-admin)
{!admin.md!}

2. Click on the **Remove admin** button.

    The selected user's browser will reload automatically, and the user will no
longer have access to the **Administration** page.

!!! tip ""
    Users can revoke their own administrative privileges if there is at least
    one other administrator in the organization.
