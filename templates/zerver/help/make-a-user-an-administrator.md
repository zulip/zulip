# Make a user an administrator

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, users join as **members**, which gives them limited access to
organization-wide settings. An organization administrator can make any other
member an administrator, or revoke admin access from any other administrator.

1. Under **User role**, select **Member** or **Administrator**.

1. Click **Save changes**. The new rights will take effect immediately.

    Users can revoke their own administrative privileges if there is at least
    one other administrator in the organization.
