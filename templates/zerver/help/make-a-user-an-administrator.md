# Make a user an administrator

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, everyone in an organization is a user; this limits them from
modifying organization-wide settings, such as changing the organization name,
activating or deactivating users, deleting streams, etc. Follow the following steps to
give any user in your organization administrative rights.

1. Go to the [Users](/#organization/user-list-admin)
{!admin.md!}

4. Click on the **Make admin** button for the user that you wish to make an
administrator.

    After clicking the **Make admin** button, the selected user's browser will
reload and the user will gain administrative privileges immediately.

## Revoke administrative rights from a user

Administrators can also revoke the administrative rights given to a user.

1. Go to the [Users](/#organization/user-list-admin)
{!admin.md!}

2. Click on the **Remove admin** button.

    The selected user's browser will reload automatically, and the user will no
longer have access to the **Organization** page.

!!! tip ""
    Users can revoke their own administrative privileges if there is at least
    one other administrator in the organization.
