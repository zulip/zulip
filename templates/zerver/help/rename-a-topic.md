# Rename a topic

Zulip makes it possible to rename topics. This is useful for keeping messages
organized, even if some users are still learning how to use topics effectively.
You can also [move content to another
topic](/help/move-content-to-another-topic).

When a topic is renamed, Zulip's [permanent links to messages in
context](/help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation#get-a-link-to-a-specific-message)
will automatically redirect to the new location of the message. [Muted
topics](/help/mute-a-topic) are automatically migrated when a topic is renamed.

Organizations can [configure](/help/configure-who-can-edit-topics) which
[roles](/help/roles-and-permissions) have permission to rename topics. See the
[guide to message and topic editing](/help/configure-message-editing-and-deletion)
for the details on when topic editing is allowed.
