# Rename a topic

By default, any user can rename any topic within a stream, and change the
topic of any message. This is useful for keeping messages organized even
if some users are still learning how to use topics effectively.

Organization administrators can additionally
[move topics](/help/move-content-to-another-stream#move-a-topic-to-another-stream)
from one stream to another, or
[move a subset of messages](/help/move-content-to-another-stream#move-messages-in-a-topic-to-another-stream)
to a topic from one stream to another.

Organization administrators can also
[configure who can edit topics](/help/configure-who-can-edit-topics),
[move topics](/help/configure-message-editing-and-deletion#configure-who-can-move-topics-between-streams),
or turn off message editing entirely. See the
[guide to message and topic editing](/help/configure-message-editing-and-deletion)
for the details on when topic editing is allowed.
