# Test mobile notifications

Normally, mobile notifications are only sent if you're idle, which isn't
ideal for testing.

You can instead have mobile notifications sent for all [private messages](/help/private-messages),
regardless of whether you're on-line.

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Under **Private messages and @-mentions**, enable
   **Mobile notifications when offline**.

1. Under **Private messages and @-mentions**, enable
   **Mobile notifications always**.
