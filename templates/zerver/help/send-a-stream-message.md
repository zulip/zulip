Once you have entered your stream name, enter the topic for your message in the **Topic** field. Your topic name can be no longer than 52 characters.

Finally, enter your message in the box labeled **Compose your message here...** or messaging box. You can now send your message to the specified stream under the specified topic.

You can always delete your message by clicking the **x** (![x](/static/images/help/x.png)) icon located at the top-right corner of your messaging box.
