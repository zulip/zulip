# Glossary
Several terms will be used in Zulip conversation. Here are some common terms that you should know.

### administrator
**Administrators** have special privileges that allow them to control the settings and customizations of the realms that they own, including the ability to deactivate and reactivate other human and bot users, delete streams, add/remove administrator privileges, as well as change configuration for the overall realm (e.g. whether an invitation is required to join the realm).
### bot
Zulip **bots** are often used for integrations to send automated messages to users and can do everything a normal user in the realm can do with a few exceptions (e.g. a bot cannot login to the web application or create other bots).
### chevron
A **chevron** is a  small downward-facing arrow (![chevron](/static/images/help/chevron.png)) icon next to a message’s timestamp that appears upon hover, offering contextual options when clicked on, such as **View Source**, **Reply**, **Collapse**, **Mute [this topic]**, and **Link to this conversation**.

### mention
To **mention** users in Zulip, you have to type `@` and their email addresses or usernames for auto-completions in your compose box. The users will be mentioned in your message as `@**username**`, and they will be notified of your message. Users can see all messages they've been mentioned in through the **@-mentions** link in the left sidebar or by using **is:mentioned** as a narrow or a search constraint.
