# @-mention a team member

When having a conversation in Zulip, it is sometimes necessary to call the
attention of another member. You can @-mention (alert) other users by
mentioning them in the body of a message.

Please note that you cannot @-mention users when you edit a message, since
they may have already read the message.

!!! tip ""
    You can view any messages calling your attention by clicking on the
    **Mentions** filters in the left sidebar.

1. Compose a [new message or reply](/help/reply-to-a-message).
2. In the **Compose your message here...** field, type `@` followed by the
email address or part of the username of the user you want to @-mention.
When you begin typing an email address or username, autocomplete suggestions
will appear.

    !!! tip ""
        You can type `@**all**` to mention everyone subscribed to the stream you
        send the message to.

    Once you select an autocomplete suggestion, the name or email address of
the user will be replaced with  `@**name**` where `name` is the name of the
selected user.

    !!! tip ""
        If you attempt to @-mention someone who is not subscribed to the
        stream in which you're posting the message, Zulip will ask if you
        would like to subscribe the user to the stream.
