# View and browse images

When someone pastes or attaches an image to a message, Zulip shows a small
preview. Click on the image preview to open the **image viewer**.

In the image viewer, you can:

* Zoom in and out of the image

* Click and drag the image

* **Reset zoom** so that the image is recentered and its original size

* **Open** the image in a new browser tab

* **Download** the image

* Browse other images in the current view. For example, if you're in a
  stream view, the image browser will show all the images from that stream. If
  you do a [search](/help/search-for-messages), the image browser will show
  all images in messages that matched that search.

Exit the image viewer by clicking anywhere outside the image.

## Troubleshooting

To open the image viewer, you must click on the image preview, not the file name.
