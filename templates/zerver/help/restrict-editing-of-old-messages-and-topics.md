    * **Users can edit their messages** - Uncheck this option if you wish to
    disable message editing. Upon doing so, the **Message edit limit in minutes (0 for no limit)**
    input field will be grayed out.

    * **Message edit limit in minutes (0 for no limit)** - If you enable message
    editing in your organization, you can restrict the time that organization
    users have to edit their messages. Simply input the time limit in minutes
    that you would like to set; for example, if you want to set a message edit
    time limit of 5 minutes, enter **5** in the field.

        !!! tip ""
            If you would like to disable the message editing time limit for your
            organization, enter **0** in the field. This enables users to edit
            their messages whenever they want.
