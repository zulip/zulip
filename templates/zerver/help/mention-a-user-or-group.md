# Mention a user or group

You can mention a team member or [user group](/help/user-groups) to call their attention to a
message. Mentions follow the same
[notification settings](/help/pm-mention-alert-notifications) as private
messages and alert words.

### From the compose box

{start_tabs}

{!start-composing.md!}

2. Type `@` followed by a few letters from a name or email address.

3. Pick the appropriate user or user group from the autocomplete.

{end_tabs}

### From the user list

{start_tabs}

1. Hover over a user in the right sidebar.

1. Click the down chevron (<i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i>) to the right.

1. Select **Reply mentioning user**.

{end_tabs}

Alternatively, click on the avatar of any user in the main message feed.

## Silently mention a user

A silent mention allows you to refer to a user without triggering a
notification. Silent mentions start with `@_` instead of `@`.

{start_tabs}

{!start-composing.md!}

2. Type `@_` followed by a few letters from a name or email address.

3. Pick the appropriate user or user group from the autocomplete.

{end_tabs}

## Mention everyone on a stream

You can mention everyone on a stream with the `@**all**` mention. Use
sparingly! Note that this will not notify anyone who has muted the stream.
