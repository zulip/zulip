# Star a message

Starring messages is a good way to keep track of important messages, such as
tasks you need to go back to or documents you reference often.

{!message-actions.md!}

1. Click the star (<i class="icon-vector-star-empty"></i>) icon.

You can access your starred messages by clicking **Starred Messages** in the
left sidebar, or by [searching](/help/search-for-messages) for `is:starred`.

Starred messages have a filled in star (<i class="icon-vector-star"></i>) to
their right. Click on it to unstar the message.
