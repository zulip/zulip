# Client libraries

These API client libraries make it easy to work with Zulip's REST API
in your favorite language.

## Official libraries

These libraries are maintained by members of the Zulip core team.  The
Python library is the most complete and best documented.

* [Python](https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip-api)
* [JavaScript](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-js)

## User maintained libraries

The Zulip core team doesn't have the resources to maintain
high-quality libraries for every programming language.  We've
collected a list of user-maintained libraries for popular languages:

* [Clojure](https://github.com/thieman/clojure-zulip)
* [C#](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-csharp)
* [Go](https://github.com/ifo/gozulipbot)
* [Java](https://github.com/taliox/zulip-java-rest)
* [Kotlin](https://gitlab.com/ppiag/kzulip)
* [PHP](https://github.com/mrferos/zulip-php-client)
* [Ruby](https://github.com/raws/wonder-llama)
* [Swift](https://github.com/zulip/swift-zulip-api)

### Contributing

Contributing to improve language libraries is appreciated, as is
writing new ones.  If you actively maintain a Zulip language binding
and would like it to be listed here (or would like to collaborate with
us in making it an official library), post in [this
topic][integrations-thread] in
[the Zulip development community](https://zulip.com/development-community/)
or submit a pull request [updating this
page](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/api.html).

### Outdated

!!! tip ""

    The following projects are not actively maintained.  Since
    Zulip's core APIs have been stable for 5 years, even very
    old libraries can be useful.
