Hey,

I wanted to share one last thing with you: a few tips about topics, since mastering topics is a key part of being a Zulip power user.

Topics are like email subject lines. The big difference, though, is that they're really short and lightweight. Two or three words will do it. Don't overthink 'em -- you can always edit the message later!

* Good topics: design mockup, Bug 345, acme burgers

* Not recommended: "What do people think of this new design mockup?", "I'm looking at Bug 345", "Is Acme Burgers open for lunch?"

Why bother with topics? Well, two reasons: it makes conversations clearer (imagine if email didn't have them!), and it lets you more efficiently catch up on what's happened while you're away -- read the topics that are relevant to you, and ignore the ones that aren't!

Take it for a spin now:

Zulip
