        Psst. Word on the street is that you need a new password, {{ email }}.<br />
        It's all good. Click here and we'll take care of the rest:<br />

        Someone (possibly you) requested a password reset email for {{ email }}
        on {{ realm_uri }}, but you do not have an
        active account in {{ realm_uri }}.

            However, you do have active accounts in the following
            organizations.
            <ul>
                {% for active_account in active_accounts %}

                {% endfor %}
            </ul>
            You can try logging in or resetting your password in the organization
            you want.
            {% else %}
            However, you do have an active account in the {{ active_accounts[0].realm.uri }}
            organization; you can try logging in or resetting your password there.
