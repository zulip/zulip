You can send emails to Zulip! This is useful:

  * If you have an email that you want to discuss on Zulip
  * For mirroring mailing list traffic
  * For integrating a third-party app that can send emails, but which does not
    easily lend itself to more direct integration

Instructions are available [here](/help/message-a-channel-by-email).
