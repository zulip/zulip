Zulip supports using Zoom as its video call provider.

### Using Zoom

1. Select Zoom as the organization's [video call provider](/help/start-a-call#changing-your-organizations-video-call-provider).

1. Zulip's [call button](/help/start-a-call) will now create meetings
   using Zoom.

The first time a user clicks the call button, they will be prompted to
link their Zoom account with their Zulip account.

**Note**: If you are self-hosting, you will need to [create a Zoom
    application](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/video-calls.html#zoom)
    in order to use this integration.

### Unlinking your Zoom account

1. Log in to the [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/).

1. Click **Manage** → **Installed Apps**.

1. Click the **Uninstall** button next to the Zulip app.
