# Use Nextcloud Talk as your call provider in Zulip

You can configure Nextcloud Talk as the call provider for your organization.
Users will be able to start a Nextcloud Talk call and invite others using the
**add video call** (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-video-call"></i>) button
[in the compose box](/help/start-a-call).

!!! warn ""

    **Note:** This is currently only possible on self-hosted Zulip
    installations, and you'll need access to a Nextcloud server with
    the Talk app enabled.

## Configure Nextcloud Talk as your call provider

By default, Zulip integrates with
[Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/), a fully-encrypted, 100% open
source video conferencing solution. You can configure Zulip to use Nextcloud
Talk as your call provider instead.

!!! warn ""

    **Note:** Zulip creates public Nextcloud Talk conversations with guest
    access, allowing anyone to join by visiting a URL and entering their
    name. This ensures that all Zulip users can join calls regardless of
    whether they have Nextcloud accounts.

1. Log in to your Nextcloud server with the user account that will be used
   for creating video call rooms.

1. Generate an app password in Nextcloud Talk for API access:
    - Go to your **Settings**, select **Personal Security** and navigate to
    the **Devices & sessions** section.
    - Set the **App name** to a name of your choice, such as `Zulip`.
    - Click **Create new app password**, and copy the generated password.

1. In `/etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf`, set `NEXTCLOUD_TALK_USERNAME` to your
   Nextcloud Talk username and `NEXTCLOUD_TALK_PASSWORD` to the app password
   you generated in the previous step.

1. In `/etc/zulip/settings.py`, set `NEXTCLOUD_SERVER` to the URL of your
   Nextcloud server.

2. Restart the Zulip server with
   `/home/zulip/deployments/current/scripts/restart-server`.
