Exchange messages between [matrix.org](https://matrix.org) and Zulip! If
you're looking to mirror an IRC channel in particular, we recommend our
[direct IRC integration](/integrations/doc/irc).

{!install-matrix.md!}

{!configure-matrix-bridge.md!}

**Note**: There are a handful of
[IRC channels](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/wiki/Channels-from-which-the-IRC-bridge-is-banned)
that have temporarily banned the Matrix.org IRC bridge.
You can't currently mirror those channels using this integration.
