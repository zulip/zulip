[Mixxx](https://mixxx.org/) is open-source DJing software built by a community
of passionate DJs and programmers from all over the world. In their nights and
weekends, and without centralized planning or deadlines, they’ve created free
software that [rivals](https://cdm.link/mixxx-2-4-2/) commercial alternatives
*and* [respects](https://www.digitaldjtips.com/reviews/mixxx-2-5-1-dj-software/)
its users.

Mixxx aims to offer DJs creative freedom that can’t be found in other software.
In the Mixxx community, collaboration between users and developers drives
product innovation. A simple question from a user can spark a clever solution.

“Zulip has become a solid foundation of our community: a place where developers,
translators, designers, and testers meet and collaborate,” core Mixxx developer
Daniel Schürmann explains in a [blog
post](https://mixxx.org/news/2025-11-17-zulip-3000_members/) occasioned by the
Mixxx Zulip community reaching 3,000 members.

## Needed: A platform to keep conversations organized and accessible

Founded in 2001, the Mixxx community originally communicated on a Mailman
mailing list and an IRC chat channel. But by 2018, these platforms were no
longer serving the community’s needs.

"As the project and number of contributors grew, we needed a platform that could
keep conversations organized and accessible to everyone,” Daniel explains on the
Mixxx blog. “Zulip… convinced us after a short evaluation period. Its unique
thread system was the ideal solution to replace structured email threads and
instant chat rooms.”

## Supporting asynchronous collaboration with structure and focus

Zulip has proven perfectly suited to support Mixxx’s worldwide community: It has
made collaboration easier, and community engagement has grown as a result.
“Zulip works particularly well for open-source projects where many topics run in
parallel, and where structure and focus are key to success,” Daniel explains.

Being able to move messages between threads helps keep conversations tidy, which
is critical for a distributed volunteer community like Mixxx: “[It] makes it
possible to collaborate asynchronously across time zones without missing
important context,” Daniel’s writes on the blog.

> Whenever a topic drifts, we can split it into a new thread, so conversations
> stay focused and are easy to follow.

The Mixxx community has dedicated channels for development, support,
socializing, and introductions. New members are encouraged to introduce
themselves in a dedicated topic with their name, where the community can welcome
them.

## Informed, but not stressed

Daniel, too, contributes to Mixxx in his spare time. Given the demands of his
day job, family and friends, “I’m not the person who can always hang around in
the chat,” he explains. “With Zulip, there’s no *need* to hang around in chat
rooms to avoid missing an important conversation.”

> With Zulip, I feel informed, but not stressed by all the messages.
>
>  — Daniel Schürmann, core Mixxx developer

Zulip’s threading model also works well for occasional participants in the
community, and world-public channels make it possible to view discussions
without even creating an account.

Daniel squeezes in some Mixxx time on his commute: “The smart phone app recently
received a major update, and is very nice,” he says.

## Creative collaboration between users and developers

A creative partnership between users and developers is core to the Mixxx
development process. Zulip supports detailed, specific discussion of any problem
reported by a user, with video and image uploads, syntax-highlighted code
blocks, and convenient quoting functionality. Everyone can keep track of
conversations in their [inbox](/help/inbox), and automatically
[follow](/help/follow-a-topic) topics they’ve participated in.

## One of the best tools, built with love

Daniel uses Microsoft Teams in his day job, and greatly prefers Zulip: “You can
experience that there’s a lot of love in Zulip,” he explains. From the smooth,
snappy interactions, to helpful touches like global times, polls, and pronouns,
it adds up.

Other community members feel it too: “Some new contributors who were skeptical
at first later told us that they consider Zulip one of the best tools for
managing communication across projects,” Daniel says.

With Zulip, the Mixxx community isn’t reliant on proprietary software built by a
mega-corporation. Daniel and other community members are glad that the Mixxx
community has found an excellent communication tool that also aligns with their
FOSS values.

> I highly recommend Zulip to other communities… Slack is a no-go for many due
> to not being FLOSS, and I’m concerned about vendor lock-in if they were to
> stop being so generous. Slack’s threading model is much worse than Zulip’s
> IMO. The channels/topics flow is an incredibly intuitive way to keep track of
> everything that is going on.
