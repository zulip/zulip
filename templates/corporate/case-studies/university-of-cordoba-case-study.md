Founded in 1613, the National University of Córdoba is the second largest
university in Argentina, with tuition-free enrollment for all. The university’s
Faculty of Mathematics, Astronomy, Physics and Computing (FAMAF) teaches classes
to over 5000 undergraduates from all over the country.

“Zulip is a key piece of how we run classes in our department,” says Nicolás
Wolovick, a professor at FAMAF and director of the computer science career
track. “If we didn’t have Zulip, I really don’t know how we’d manage it.”

## Sponsored hosting for a modern team chat app

For a while, FAMAF used Moodle’s course management software to communicate with
students, but “it was a pain,” Nicolás recalls. The department tried moving to
Slack. However, without a software budget, the message history limit on Slack’s
free plan was a major frustration.

In search of an alternative, a faculty member reached out to request a sponsored
Zulip Cloud Standard plan. With the request approved the very next day, the
department moved over to Zulip starting starting in Fall 2020.

Looking back, being pushed off Slack by its search history limit ended up being
for the best: “I think Zulip is a great tool, much better than Slack,” says
Miguel Pagano, professor at FAMAF.

## Zulip becomes a knowledge base

Zulip has become part of the core flow of how faculty at FAMAF run their
classes. Instructors create channels for the classes they teach each semester.
For lab classes, instructors make private channels for communication with each
project group. “I use pinned channels to focus on the two subjects I’m teaching
right now,” Nicolás notes.

Discussions from prior semesters are available for easy reference, so
instructors can simply point students to past conversations for answers to their
questions. “Zulip acts as a knowledge database of what we did in each subject,”
Nicolás explains. “The search is perfect.”

> We can find messages from five years ago — it’s very convenient.

## A cross-generational app for instructors and students

Many members of the faculty prefer familiar tools, and sometimes find the UI of
apps like Discord overwhelming. So it matters that Zulip has a clean interface,
with channels and conversations inside channels clearly presented. There are
also some friendly touches: “I love using Markdown for message formatting, and
that you can copy-paste formatted text, and it translates accurately,” Nicolás
notes.

And while students hardly use email, Nicolás and other faculty appreciate being
able to send messages to Zulip by replying to email notifications.

At the same time, Zulip offers fun features for the students. “We have a whole
subculture of custom emoji,” Nicolás says. “Students love to use them to
customize the space and express themselves.”

Still, the overall vibe is professional, and moderation has never been an issue.
“I’ve never had to ban anyone or even delete a message,” Nicolás says. Students
keep their Zulip account after graduation, which provides a way for faculty and
alumni to stay connected.
