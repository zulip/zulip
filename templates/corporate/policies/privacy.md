## Data Security and Retention

We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and
disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and
administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we
are processing that data. You should also help protect your data by
appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on
mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing
off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect
the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please
be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data
is completely secure.

We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with
us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services. In some cases we
retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our
legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise
permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further
retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information
would not identify you personally.

## Personal Data of Children

As noted in the Terms of Service, we do not knowingly collect or solicit
personally identifiable information from children under thirteen (13) years of
age and children below the [minimum age of consent in their
country](/policies/age-of-consent); if you are a
child under the age of thirteen (13) or below the minimum age of consent in your
country, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or
send us any personal information. If we learn we have collected personal
information from a child under thirteen (13) years of age or below the minimum
age of consent in their country, we will delete that information as quickly as
possible. If you believe that a child under the age of thirteen (13) or below
the minimum age of consent in their country may have provided us personal
information, please contact us at [privacy@zulip.com](mailto:privacy@zulip.com).

## California Resident Rights under CCPA

If you are a California resident, you have the rights set forth in this section.
Please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section below for instructions regarding
how to exercise these rights. Please note that we may process Personal Data of
our customers’ end users or employees in connection with our provision of
certain services to our customers. If we are processing your Personal Data as a
service provider, you should contact the entity that collected your Personal
Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.

If there are any conflicts between this section and any other
provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident,
the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to
the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this
section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please
contact us at [privacy@zulip.com](mailto:privacy@zulip.com).

### Access

You have the right to request certain information about our collection, use, and
disclosure of your Personal Data over the past 12 months. In response, we will
provide you with the following information:

- The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.
- The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.
- The business or commercial purpose for collecting, using, or disclosing your
  Personal Data.
- The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data,
  along with a reminder that we do not sell Personal Data.
- The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.

### Deletion

You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have
collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain
exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you
with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested.
If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your
deletion request. Please note that we will not be able to delete messages or
other content that you have sent to another Zulip user. If you request deletion
of your account, all such messages and content will be associated with a
“Deleted User.” In addition, please note that anyone that you send messages or
other content to (or who may otherwise have access to such messages or content
through a Zulip Organization or channel) may have downloaded or copied such
messages or content. Zulip will not be able to delete such downloaded or copied
messages or content.

### Exercising Your Rights

To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined
below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow
us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data,
which may include proof of ownership of the email address associated with your
Zulip account, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us
to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these
criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests
that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a
Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need
an account to submit a Valid Request. We will work to respond to your Valid
Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a
Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or
manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we
will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your
request. You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:

- Email us at: [privacy@zulip.com](mailto:privacy@zulip.com).
- Complete this form on our website: <https://zulip.com/support>.

You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights
on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written
permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may require you to
confirm to us that you did so.

### Personal Data Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In

We will not sell your Personal Data, and have not done so over the last 12
months.

### We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA

We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA.
We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or
rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your
rights under the CCPA.

## Other State Law Privacy Rights

### California Resident Rights

Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are
entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of Personal Data to third parties
for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes In order to submit such a
request, please contact us at [privacy@zulip.com](mailto:privacy@zulip.com).

Zulip does not disclose Personal Data to any third parties for the purpose of
such parties’ direct marketing.  However, please note that your Zulip display
name, email address, avatar, and other profile information may be shared with
other users within any Zulip Organization that you join. You can confirm or
change these settings in your
[profile](/accounts/go/?next=%23settings%2Fprofile), and [account and
privacy](/accounts/go/?next=%23settings%2Faccount-and-privacy) settings.

### Nevada Resident Rights

As noted above, we do not sell Personal Data.

If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the
sale of certain Personal Data to third parties who intend to license
or sell that Personal Data. You can exercise this right by contacting
us at [privacy@zulip.com](mailto:privacy@zulip.com) with the subject
line “Nevada Do Not Sell Request” and providing us with your name and
the email address associated with your account.

## European Union Data Subject Rights

### EU Residents

If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom,
Lichtenstein, Norway or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU
General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal
Data, as outlined below.

For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are
defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be
used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers
actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use,
storage and disclosure. Zulip will be the controller of your Personal Data
processed in connection with the Services.

If there are any conflicts between this section and any other
provision of this Privacy Policy, the provision or portion that is
more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such
conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any
of the following applies to you, please contact us at
[privacy@zulip.com](mailto:privacy@zulip.com). Note that we may also
process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or employees in
connection with our provision of certain services to customers, in
which case we are the processor of Personal Data. If we are the
processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller), please
contact the controller party in the first instance to address your
rights with respect to such data.

### Personal Data We Collect

The “Categories of Personal Data We Collect” section above details the Personal
Data that we collect from you.

### Personal Data Use and Processing Grounds

The “Our Commercial or Business Purposes for Collecting Personal Data” section
above explains how we use your Personal Data.

We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so.
Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity and our
“legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, as further
described below.

- **Contractual Necessity**:  We process the following categories of Personal
  Data as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process
  the data in order to carry out our obligations under the Terms of Service,
  including providing the Services. When we process data due to contractual
  necessity, failure to process such Personal Data will result in your or other
  Zulip users’ inability to use some or all portions of the Services that
  require such data.
    - Profile or Contact Data
    - Payment Data
    - Other Identifying Information You Voluntarily Choose to Provide
    - Other Identifying Information Another User Chooses to Provide to You

- **Legitimate Interest**:  We process the following categories of Personal Data
  when we believe it furthers the legitimate interest of us or third parties:
    - Device/IP Data
    - Web Analytics
    - Geolocation Data
    - Other Identifying Information Another User Chooses to Provide to You
    - We may also de-identify or anonymize Personal Data to further our
      legitimate interests. Examples of these legitimate interests include:
        - Providing, customizing and improving the Services
        - Marketing the Services
        - Corresponding with you
        - Meeting legal requirements and enforcing legal terms
        - Completing corporate transactions

- **Consent**:  In some cases, we process Personal Data based on the consent you
  expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data. When we process
  Personal Data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at
  the point and time of collection. This information may include:
    - Social Network Data

- **Other Processing Grounds**:  From time to time we may also need to process
  Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect
  the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a
  task carried out in the public interest.

### Sharing Personal Data

The “How We Share Your Personal Data” section above details how we share your
Personal Data with third parties.

### EU and UK Data Subject Rights

You have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data, including
those set forth below. For more information about these rights, or to
submit a request, please email us at
[privacy@zulip.com](mailto:privacy@zulip.com). Please note that in
some circumstances, we may not be able to fully comply with your
request, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it
jeopardizes the rights of others, or if it is not required by law, but
in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a
decision. In some cases, we may also need you to provide us with
additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary
to verify your identity and the nature of your request.

- **Access**:  You can request more information about the Personal Data we hold
  about you and request a copy of such Personal Data. You can also access
  certain of your Personal Data by logging on to your account.
- **Rectification**:  If you believe that any Personal Data we are holding about
  you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that we correct or supplement
  such data. You can also correct some of this information directly by logging
  on to your account in the Zulip web application.
- **Erasure**:  You can request that we erase some or all of your Personal Data
  from our systems.  Please note that we will not be able to delete messages or
  other content that you have sent to another Zulip user. If you request
  deletion of your account, all such messages and content will be associated
  with a “Deleted User.”  In addition, please note that anyone that you send
  messages or other content to (or who may otherwise have access to such
  messages or content through a Zulip Organization or channel), may have
  downloaded or copied such messages or content. Zulip will not be able to
  delete such downloaded or copied messages or content.
- **Withdrawal of Consent**:  If we are processing your Personal Data based on
  your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have
  the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that if
  you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a
  case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data,
  if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of
  our Services.
- **Portability**:  You can ask for a copy of your Personal Data in a
  machine-readable format. You can also request that we transmit the data to
  another controller where technically feasible.
- **Objection**:  You can contact us to let us know that you object to the
  further use or disclosure of your Personal Data for certain purposes, such as
  for direct marketing purposes.
- **Restriction of Processing**:  You can ask us to restrict further processing
  of your Personal Data.

  Zulip's practices with respect to your Personal Data with the supervisory
  authority of your country or EU Member State. A list of Supervisory
  Authorities is available here:
  <https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en>.

### Transfers of Personal Data

The Services are hosted and operated in the United States (“U.S.”) through Zulip
and its service providers, and if you do not reside in the U.S., laws in the
U.S. may differ from the laws where you reside. By using the Services, you
acknowledge that any Personal Data about you, regardless of whether provided by
you or obtained from a third party, is being provided to Zulip in the U.S. and
will be hosted on U.S. servers, and you authorize Zulip to transfer, store and
process your information to and in the U.S., and possibly other countries.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this
Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do so, we will alert you to any such
changes by placing a notice on the Zulip website, by sending you an email and/or
by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal
notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address),
those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are
still responsible for reading and understanding them. We will generally aim to
provide such notice about Privacy Policy changes at least 14 days in advance of
the new Privacy Policy taking effect. If you use the Services after any changes
to the Privacy Policy have come into effect, that means you agree to all of the
changes. Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in
effect at the time such information is collected.
