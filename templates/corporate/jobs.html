                        <strong>Open source.</strong> The Zulip software is 100% free and
                        open source.  We're <a href="/team/">an open-source project</a> first,
                        and we’re building a sustainable business as a means to support the
                        project's growth and long-term future. We provide the same open-source
                        code to our largest customers as to anyone with <code>git clone</code>.
                        We get paid by enterprises for support, and by smaller companies using
                        our rapidly-growing hosted service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Open project.</strong> The Zulip project is one where people
                        really do show up through the Internet and start making real changes.
                        That doesn’t happen by accident; it takes work and thoughtfulness.  Most
                        of us work remotely, and we discuss our code and our plans in public, in
                        writing, primarily asynchronously, using Zulip and GitHub.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Inclusive community.</strong> The Zulip community is made up of a
                        mixture of volunteers and professionals from all walks of life. Diversity is
                        one of our strengths, and we strive to be a community that welcomes and
                        supports people of all backgrounds and identities from anywhere in the world.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Globally distributed.</strong> Our company is
                        headquartered in San Francisco, CA, but like our community,
                        we work from around the world. Our roles
                        are open to all applicants without regard for location.

                        <strong>Maintainable software.</strong> Great
                        software over time depends on a team’s shared
                        understanding of a system and how to change it, as
                        much as on the code itself. Beyond writing our
                        code so it works today, we put equal effort into
                        writing code, tests, comments, commit history,
                        and <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a>
                        clearly, to share with each other and future
                        contributors our understanding of how and why it
                        works, so we can build on it tomorrow.

                        People working together need to communicate with their teammates, and they
                        also need to tune out the conversation to get work done. Teams tired of
                        wasting time in meetings move discussion to email; tired of waiting all
                        day for email replies, move to a team chat like Slack or IRC; and then
                        team chat becomes an always-on meeting, leaving people constantly
                        distracted, missing out on important conversations, or both.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Zulip is reinventing chat so teams can accomplish more together. We've
                        created a place where a conversation can shift seamlessly from the
                        immediacy of chat to the reply-whenever efficiency of email, and back;
                        where you can participate in the conversations that matter to you and
                        efficiently tune out the rest, no matter whether you're there in real
                        time, coming online after a morning hard at work, or returning from a
                        vacation away from it.
