# Follow a topic

Zulip lets you follow topics you are interested in. You can follow or unfollow
any topic. You can also configure Zulip to automatically follow topics you start
or participate in. Participating in a topic means sending a message,
[reacting](/help/emoji-reactions) with an emoji, or participating in a
[poll](/help/create-a-poll). You can also automatically follow topics where you
are [mentioned](/help/mention-a-user-or-group).

It's easy to prioritize catching up on followed topics. You can:

- [Configure](/help/follow-a-topic#configure-notifications-for-followed-topics)
  how you get notified about new messages for topics you follow.

- Use the <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> [keyboard
  shortcut](/help/keyboard-shortcuts) to go to the next unread followed topic.

- Filter the [**inbox**](/help/inbox) and [**recent
  conversations**](/help/recent-conversations) views to only show followed
  topics.

- See which topics you are following in the **left sidebar**.

You can use followed topics for a variety of workflows:
