# Import your settings

When you create a Zulip account using an email address already associated with
an account in another Zulip organization, on Zulip Cloud or the same self-hosted
Zulip installation, you can import your user settings from an existing account.
It's a convenient way to preserve the user settings that you've already customized.

    Settings that may not apply to all organizations, such as custom profile
    fields, will not be imported.

The import will include your:

- [Name](/help/change-your-name) and [profile picture](/help/change-your-profile-picture).
- [Preferences](/help/review-your-settings#review-your-preferences), such as the
  [theme](/help/dark-theme), [font size](/help/font-size),
  [emoji set](/help/emoji-and-emoticons#change-your-emoji-set), and
  [language](/help/change-your-language) you have configured.
- [Privacy settings](/help/review-your-settings#review-your-privacy-settings),
  which include whether you let others see [when you are typing][send-typing-notifications]
  or [if you have read a message][share-read-receipts].
- [Notification settings](/help/review-your-settings#review-your-notification-settings),
  which include [default notifications for channels](/help/channel-notifications),
