# Review your organization settings

It's good to periodically review your organization's settings. Zulip is in
active development and is constantly adding new features, and as your
organization grows, features that may not have been applicable at a small
scale may be applicable now.

Note that most organization settings are visible to all users, though
generally only organization administrators can interact with them.
