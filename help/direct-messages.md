# Direct messages

**Direct messages (DMs)** are one-on-one conversations between you and
another user. **Group direct messages (group DMs)** are small
discussions with a group of users.

DMs and group DMs work well for one-off conversations. If you find yourself
frequently conversing with the same person or the same group of people, we
highly recommend [creating a private stream](/help/create-a-stream) for your
conversations instead.

Note that group DMs are not the same as [user groups](/help/user-groups) or
private streams. DMs and group DMs do not have [topics](/help/streams-and-topics)
and do not appear in your list of streams.
