# Dark theme

Zulip provides both a light theme and a dark theme, which is great
for working in a dark space.

## Manage color theme

{start_tabs}

{tab|desktop-web}

{settings_tab|preferences}


1. Under **General**, select the desired color scheme from the **Theme** dropdown.


The default is **Automatic (follows system settings)**, which detects which theme to use based
on the color scheme used by your operating system.

You can also specify **Light** or **Dark** if you'd like

Zulip to use the same color scheme regardless of your operating system
configuration.

{tab|mobile}

{!mobile-profile-menu.md!}

1. Tap **Settings**.

1. Toggle **Night mode**.

{end_tabs}
