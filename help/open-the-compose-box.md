# Open the compose box

The Zulip compose box starts off closed by default, leaving more vertical
space for the message feed. There are a number of ways to open the compose box.

## Using the mouse

* Click on any message.

* Click on **Start new conversation**, or **New direct message** at the
  bottom of the app.

## Using the keyboard

All replies are to the message in the **blue box**.

* **Reply**: <kbd>R</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>

* **New topic**: <kbd>C</kbd>

* **New direct message**: <kbd>X</kbd>

You can move the blue box around using the **arrow keys**, <kbd>J</kbd>, or
<kbd>K</kbd>. You can close the compose box using <kbd>Esc</kbd>, or up/down
arrow if the box is empty.
