# Configure who can subscribe other users to channels

## Configure who can subscribe others to channels in general

Subscribing someone to a channel requires having content access to that channel.
All [members](/help/user-roles) of an organization can access content in [public
channels](/help/channel-permissions).

For [private channels](/help/channel-permissions), content access must be
granted explicitly. Users have content access if:

{!content-access-definition.md!}

{!admin-only.md!}

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-permissions}

1. Under **Channel permissions**, configure **Who can subscribe others to channels**.

{!save-changes.md!}

{end_tabs}

## Configure who can subscribe anyone to a specific channel

If you have permission to administer a public channel, you can configure who can
subscribe anyone to it. For [private
channels](/help/channel-permissions#private-channels), you additionally need to
have content access in order to change this configuration.

{start_tabs}

{relative|channel|all}

1. Select a channel.

{!select-channel-view-general.md!}

1. Under **Channel permissions**, configure **Who can subscribe anyone to this
   channel**.

{!save-changes.md!}

{end_tabs}
