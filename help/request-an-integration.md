# Request an integration

Zulip comes with over 100 native integrations. Hundreds more are
available through
[Zapier](https://zapier.com/home), [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), and
the [Slack compatible webhook](/integrations/doc/slack_incoming).

However, sometimes there is no integration for a tool you use, or an
existing integration doesn't do what you need. If that's the case for
a third-party product you use, we'd love to [hear about
it](/help/contact-support)!

Or if you're familiar with GitHub, you can [browse open integrations
issues][integrations-issues], and if none exists, [open a new
issue](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/new).
