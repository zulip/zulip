# Migrating from other chat tools

If your organization is moving to Zulip from another chat tool, you can use
Zulip's tools to import your data, including users, channels, messages, and
more. Follow the detailed import guides:

* [Import from Slack](/help/import-from-slack). Zulip's [Slack-compatible
  incoming webhook](https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/slack_incoming) also
  makes it easy to migrate any integrations.
* [Import from Mattermost](/help/import-from-mattermost)
* [Import from Rocket.Chat](/help/import-from-rocketchat)

    **You can only import a workspace as a new Zulip organization.** Your imported
    message history cannot be added into an existing Zulip organization.
