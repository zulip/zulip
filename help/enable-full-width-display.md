# Enable full width display

By default, Zulip limits the width of the center message pane, because it's
easier and faster to read paragraphs that don't have long lines. This is
also why many news sites, blogs, and social media platforms limit their
paragraph width.

You can instead configure Zulip to use the full width of wide screens.

### Enable full width display

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|preferences}

1. Under **Advanced**, select **Use full width on wide screens**.

{end_tabs}
