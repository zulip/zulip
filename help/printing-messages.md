# Printing messages

Zulip lets you print the messages in any view, including
[conversations](/help/reading-conversations), [direct message
conversations](/help/reading-dms), and [searches](/help/search-for-messages).

Printouts include just the content you need, without sidebars and buttons.
Messages will be printed with black text on a white background, regardless of
whether you're using [light or dark theme](/help/dark-theme).
