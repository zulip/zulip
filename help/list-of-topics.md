# List of topics in a channel

You can view a list of recent topics any channel. It's a great way to get an
overview if you like reading your messages one channel at a time.

## Use the list of topics in a subscribed channel

{start_tabs}

{tab|desktop-web}

{!channel-actions.md!}

1. Click **Go to list of topics**. If you do not see this option, Zulip is
   [configured](#configure-where-channel-links-in-the-left-sidebar-go) so that
   clicking on the channel name in the left sidebar will take you directly to
   the list of topics.

1. Click on a conversation you're interested in to view it. You can return to
   the list of topics when done (e.g., by using the **back** button in your
   browser or desktop app) to select the next conversation.

    Use <kbd>Y</kbd> to go to the list of topics for the current channel.

1. Tap **topics** (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-topic-list mobile-help"></i>)
   in the upper right corner of the app.

1. Tap on a conversation you're interested in to view it. You can return to

## Filter conversations

### Filter by topic status

In the web app, you can control whether the list of topics includes all topics,
just topics you haven't [muted](/help/mute-a-topic), or only topics you
[follow](/help/follow-a-topic).

{start_tabs}

{tab|desktop-web}

1. In the list of topics for a channel, select **All topics**, **Standard
   view**, or **Followed topics** from the dropdown in the upper left.

{end_tabs}

In muted channels, the **Standard view** includes all topics you haven't
explicitly muted.

### Filter by keyword

{start_tabs}

{tab|desktop-web}

1. In the list of topics for a channel, use the **Filter** box at the top to
   find a conversation.
