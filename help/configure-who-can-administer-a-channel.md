# Configure who can administer a channel

!!! warn ""

    Organization administrators can automatically administer all channels.

If you have permission to administer a [public](/help/channel-permissions) or [web-public](/help/public-access-option) channel, you can:

- See and modify the channel's [name](/help/rename-a-channel) and [description](/help/change-the-channel-description).
- [Subscribe](/help/add-or-remove-users-from-a-channel#add-users-to-a-channel) and [unsubscribe](/help/add-or-remove-users-from-a-channel#remove-users-from-a-channel) users.
- Modify the channel's permissions settings, including settings that control who
  can see messages in the channel (public vs. private, shared history vs.
  protected history).
- [Archive](/help/archive-a-channel) the channel.

For [private](/help/channel-permissions) channels, you additionally need to be a
subscriber in order to add subscribers or change channel permissions.
