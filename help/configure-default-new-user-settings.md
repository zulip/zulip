# Configure default settings for new users

{!admin-only.md!}

Organization administrators can configure the default values of
personal preference settings for new users joining the
organization. This can help seamlessly customize the Zulip experience
to match how the organization in question is using Zulip.

Existing users' preferences cannot be modified by administrators, and
users will be able to customize their own settings once they
join. Administrators can customize defaults for all personal
preference settings, including the following:

* Privacy settings, including:
    * [Displaying availability to other users](/help/status-and-availability)
    * [Allowing others to see when the user has read messages](/help/read-receipts)
* Preferences, including:
    * Default view ([Recent conversations](/help/recent-conversations) vs.
      [All messages](/help/reading-strategies#all-messages))
    * [Light theme vs. dark theme](/help/dark-theme)
    * [Emoji theme](/help/emoji-and-emoticons#change-your-emoji-set)
    * [Time format](/help/change-the-time-format)
* Notification settings, including:
    * [What types of messages trigger notifications][default-notifications]
    * [Configurations for email notifications](/help/email-notifications)

[default-notifications]: /help/stream-notifications#set-default-notifications-for-all-streams
