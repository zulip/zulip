# Set your profile picture

By default, Zulip uses an image generated by
[Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) as your profile picture.
If your email address already has a gravatar associated with it, Zulip will
use your existing gravatar.

You can also upload a custom profile picture to Zulip.

### Set your profile picture

### Set profile picture back to gravatar

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|profile}

2. Under **Profile picture**, click on the **(X)** icon in the top
right corner of the profile picture.

3. Approve by clicking **Confirm**. This will remove your current
profile picture, reverting to the Gravatar default.
