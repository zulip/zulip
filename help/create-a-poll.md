# Polls

Zulip makes it easy to create a poll. Polls in Zulip are collaborative, so
anyone can add new options to a poll. However, only the creator of the poll can
edit the question.

## Create a poll

1. Click the **Add poll** icon at the bottom of the compose box.

1. Fill out poll information as desired, and click **Add poll** to insert poll
   formatting.

1. Click the **Send** (<i class="zulip-icon zulip-icon-send"></i>) button, or
   use a [keyboard
   shortcut](/help/mastering-the-compose-box#toggle-between-ctrl-enter-and-enter-to-send-a-message)
   to send your message.
