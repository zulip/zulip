## Mention everyone on a stream

You can mention everyone on a stream with the `@**all**` mention (or,
equivalently, `@**everyone**` or `@**stream**`). Use sparingly! Used improperly,
wildcard mentions can be annoying.

Note that this will not notify anyone who has muted the stream, and
users can disable receiving email/push notifications for these
wildcard mentions, either
[globally](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications) or for [individual
streams](/help/stream-notifications).
