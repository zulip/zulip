# “*General chat*” topic

Zulip's [topics](/help/introduction-to-topics) help you keep conversations
organized, but you may sometimes want to send a message without a topic. For
example, this could be appropriate for social chatter, or for a one-off request
(e.g., “Is anyone around to help me out?”).

The “*general chat*” topic can be used only if [allowed](/help/require-topics)
by your organization's administrators, and channels can be
[configured](/help/general-chat-channels) to only allow the “*general chat*”
topic.
