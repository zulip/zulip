# Mastering the compose box

Here is an overview of all the information and actions you can take in Zulip's
compose box.

![Compose box information and actions](/static/images/help/compose-actions.png)

## Compose Box Navigation Shortcuts

{start_tabs}
You can use the following keyboard shortcuts to navigate the compose box:

- **`Tab`**: Move forward through compose box icons (e.g from preview to link).

- **`Shift`** + **`Tab`**: Move backward through fields (e.g from
previously chosen channel to channel dropdown or from selected user to
Direct Message ).

- Toggle between **`Ctrl`** + **`Return`** and **`Return`** key adds a
new line to your message, and **`Ctrl`** + **`Return`** sends your message.

This is convenient for typing multi-line messages,which is common in
Zulip chat products.

## Composing to a different conversation

When composing a message, Zulip lets you view a different
[conversation](/help/reading-conversations) from the one you are composing to.
For example, you can start a new topic without changing your view, send a
direct message about the topic you're viewing, or look up a related discussion.

In this context, the parts of the message view that are outside of the
conversation you are composing to are faded for clarity.

### Change where you are composing to

No matter where you start composing your message, it's easy to change where it
will be sent.

{start_tabs}

{tab|channel-compose}

{!start-composing.md!}

1. Select any channel from the dropdown in the top left of the compose box. You can
   start typing to filter channels.

1. Enter a topic name. Auto-complete will provide suggestions for previously
   used topics.

{tab|dm-compose}

{!start-composing.md!}

1. Select **Direct message** from the dropdown in the top left of the compose
   box.

1. Start typing the name of the person you want to message, and
   select their name from the list of suggestions. You can continue
   adding as many message recipients as you like.

{end_tabs}

### Go to conversation

Zulip lets you jump to the [conversation](/help/reading-conversations) you're
currently composing to.

{start_tabs}

1. [Open the compose box](/help/open-the-compose-box).

1. Click the highlighted **Go to conversation** button at the top of
   the compose box. It will be clickable only if you're viewing
   a different conversation from the one you are composing to.

!!! keyboard_tip ""

    Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> to go to the conversation
    you're composing to.

{end_tabs}

### Forward a message

To forward a message, use the **Quote and reply** feature:

{start_tabs}

1. Hover on the message you want to forward and click the three vertical dots (⋮)
to open the menu.

2. Select the **Quote and reply** option from the menu.

3. The message will appear quoted in the compose box.

4. Change the recipient in the compose box (either channel or direct message).

5. Edit or add any additional text, and then send the message.

{end_tabs}

### Automatically go to conversation where you sent a message

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|preferences}

1. Under **Navigation**, toggle **Automatically go to conversation
where you sent a message**, as desired.

{end_tabs}

## Toggle between **`Ctrl`** + **`Enter`** and **`Enter`** to send a message

By default, the **`Enter`** key adds a new line to your message,
and **`Ctrl`** + **`Enter`** sends your message.

This is convenient for typing multi-line messages, which are more common in
Zulip than in most other chat products. However, you can also configure
Zulip so that the **`Enter`** key sends your message.

!!! tip ""

    <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> always adds a new line, regardless
    of whether **<kbd>Enter</kbd> to send** is enabled.

### Enable **`Enter`** to send

{start_tabs}

{!start-composing.md!}

1. Click on the **ellipsis**
   in the bottom right corner of the compose box, next to the **Send**
   button.

1. Select **`Enter` to send**.

{end_tabs}

### Enable **`Ctrl` + `Enter` to send**

{start_tabs}

{!start-composing.md!}

1. Click on the **ellipsis**
   in the bottom right corner of the compose box, next to the **Send**
   button.
