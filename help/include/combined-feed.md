The **Combined feed** view is a feed of all the unmuted messages you have
received, which combines channel messages and direct messages. It's a great way
to see new messages as they come in.

You can configure **Combined feed** to be the [home
view](/help/configure-home-view#configure-home-view) for the Zulip web app.
