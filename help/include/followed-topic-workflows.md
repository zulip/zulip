- [Catch up](/help/follow-a-topic#catch-up-on-followed-topics) on
  followed topics at the start of the day, and whenever you want to
  spend a few minutes checking on on the conversations that need
  your attention.

- No more stressing about missing a reply to your message in channels
  you don't regularly read. You can [automatically
  follow](/help/follow-a-topic#automatically-follow-topics) topics you
  start or participate in.

- You can also [mute](/help/mute-a-channel) the channels you don't
  regularly read, and [automatically follow or
  unmute](/help/follow-a-topic#automatically-follow-topics) topics you
  start or participate in. In muted channels, topics you follow are
  automatically treated as [unmuted](/help/mute-a-topic), so it will
  be easy to see when someone responds to your message.

- If you like, follow just the topics where your prompt attention is
  needed, and [enable desktop and mobile
  notifications](/help/follow-a-topic#configure-notifications-for-followed-topics)
  for followed topics.
