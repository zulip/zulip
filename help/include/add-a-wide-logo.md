You can customize the logo users see in the top left corner
of the Zulip app. For best results:

- The logo should be a wide rectangle image with an 8:1 width to height ratio.
  It will be displayed at 200×25 pixels, or more on high-resolution displays.

- Make sure your logo has a transparent background, and trim any bordering
  whitespace.

To upload a logo:

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-profile}

1. Under **Organization logo**, upload a new logo.

{end_tabs}

Make sure to test the logo in both light theme and [dark theme](/help/dark-theme).
