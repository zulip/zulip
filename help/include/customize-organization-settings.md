A few settings to highlight:

* Decide [who can invite new users][who-can-invite], or whether
  [anyone can join without an invitation][who-can-join].

* [Set visibility for users' email addresses][email-address-visibility].

* If your organization uses a programming language, set the [default
  language for code blocks][default-code-block-language]. Also
  consider setting up [code playgrounds][code-playgrounds].

* If your organization uses code repositories, [set up
  linkifiers](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier) to make it easy to link to
  issues (e.g. just by typing #1234 for issue 1234).

* [Add custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji), including your organization's logo.

For many other settings, e.g., [message][message-editing-permissions] and
[topic][topic-editing-permissions] editing permissions, you can experience how
Zulip works for your organization before deciding what settings are best for
you.
