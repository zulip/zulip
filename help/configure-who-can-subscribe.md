# Configure who can subscribe to a channel

You can give users permission to subscribe to a channel. Everyone other than
guests can subscribe to any public channel, so this feature is intended for use
with private channels. Guests can never subscribe themselves to a channel.

This permission grants access to channel content, so users will also be able to
read messages in the channel without subscribing.

For example, you can give your team's group permission to subscribe to each of
your team's channels. This way, a designer could follow a link to a conversation
in the private engineering channel for their team, without having to be
subscribed. They could subscribe to the channel if they need to respond, without
asking for help.

If you have permission to administer a public channel, you can configure who can
subscribe to it. For [private
channels](/help/channel-permissions#private-channels), you additionally need to
have content access in order to change this configuration.
