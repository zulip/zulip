# Create a stream

By default, all users other than guests can create streams. Administrators can
[restrict the ability to create a stream](/help/configure-who-can-create-streams) to specific
[roles](/help/roles-and-permissions).

If you are an administrator setting up streams for the first time, check out our
[guide to setting up streams for a new organization](/help/create-streams).

## Stream options

There are several parameters you can set while creating a stream. All but
**Announce stream** you can change later.

* **Stream name**: Appears in the left sidebar for subscribed users. The
  stream name can be in any language, and can include spaces and other
  punctuation.

* **Stream description**: Helps users decide whether to subscribe when they
  are browsing streams.

* **Announce new stream in the [stream configured by your organization](/help/configure-notification-bot#new-stream-announcements)**:
  Posts a message in the "new streams" topic advertising the new stream.

* **Who can access the stream?**: See [Stream permissions](/help/stream-permissions).

* **Who can post to the stream?**: See [Stream permissions](/help/stream-permissions).

* **Who can unsubscribe others from this stream?**: See
  [Restrict stream membership management](/help/configure-who-can-invite-to-streams#configure-who-can-remove-users).

* **Message retention period**: See
  [Message retention policy](/help/message-retention-policy#configure-message-retention-policy-for-individual-streams).

* **Choose subscribers**: You can copy the membership from an existing stream or
  [user group](/help/user-groups), add all users, or enter users one by one.
