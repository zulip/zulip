## How to create a channel

{!create-a-channel-instructions.md!}

## Tips for creating channels

* It's often best to start with just a few channels, and add more as
  needed. For small teams, you can start with the default channels
  and go from there.

* A channel's name can be in any language, and can include spaces, punctuation,
  and Unicode emoji. For large organizations, we recommend using a consistent naming
  scheme, like `#marketing/<name>` or `#mk/<name>` for all channels
  pertaining to the marketing team, `#help/<team name>` for
  `<team name>`'s internal support channel, etc.

* You can [pin reference information](/help/pin-information), such as important
  messages or topics, and external references, in the
  [description](/help/view-channel-information#view-channel-description) for a
  channel.

* For open source projects or other volunteer organizations, consider
  adding default channels like **#announce** for announcements, **#new
  members** for new members to introduce themselves and be welcomed,
  and **#help** so that there's a clear place users stopping by with
  just a single question can post.
